come down take 10 minutes
gonna go the market
nobody enters the forest

also have a chance to see another animals
sometime we find a buffalo, sometimes we find an elephant

follow the example of the guide, stand up: stand up, 
goes down, goes down

never run away

...


sometimes babies come to touch you
babies come to touch you

if you want to go to toilet

machete, make a small hole
very important it is forest not a toilet
number one not a problem, number two is a big problem

other gorillas behind you

you have a picknick

you take a picture, no flash
no pointing of the finger towards the gorillas

and, aah, normally ...

one hour for you

people you change your camera, films,
people you smoke? ... all not smoke! oh my god

take your camera, take your film


people go slowly
stop, enter the forest, tell me
you have a question, you ask me or my friend

thank you so much
buffalo come charge

follow my friend

good
