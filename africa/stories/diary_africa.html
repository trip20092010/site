<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Changed planes after some non
serious passport and security control. They were still checking the
body temperature of the arriving people with cameras. We had no
fever, so we were admitted to the country. Arrived to Nairobi early
in the morning at 3.45. got the visa at the airport without problems.
Nobody wanted to see any documents, travel itinerary or alike, banks
statements or onward ticket, which the embassies in Europe made so
much hassle about. We only had to file the application form and pay
25 USD and that was it. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">At the exit of the airport some
stalkers were waiting for the tourist to offer them shuttle rides,
taxi service and safaris. As we had our shuttle booked through the
internet (Riverside shuttle), all we had to do was to wait in a bar
there at the airport 5 hours for our bus to arrive. There were quite
a lot of other people doing the same. A representative of the
riverside company showed up within a few hours and confirmed our
booking. She also sold us the tickets for the ride back to Nairobi.
Interestingly she went pretty much below the price we paid online,
offering a house to house service for 25 USD/ person instead of 35
USD. So when finally the shuttle arrived it was only half an hour
late and surprisingly all the people waiting fit into it. The bags
were secured on the roof of the bus and we were ready to go. Soon
enough we found out about the terrible status of the roads in Kenya
and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><IMG SRC="diary_africa_html_235608a2.gif" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=627 HEIGHT=471 BORDER=0>Even
though the distance between Nairobi and Arusha was only some 250 kms,
it took us 7 hours to cover. It felt that the driver could only honk
and press the accelerator pedal, but not really drive. It felt that
he was speeding with 100 km/h on the creepy dust roads, taking over
everybody and scaring the pedestrians and bikers on the road by
honking at them. The landscape was quite different than what I have
imagined of Africa. Along the road there were many settlements
stretched out and almost every shabby building along the road was a
store or a bar. They were selling everything: hardware, computers,
cell phones, vet products, clothes, we even saw medical laboratory
services being offered in some buildings. In those settlements many
people were standing and hanging out along the road, seemingly doing
nothing. Some kids were playing: chasing bike tires with a stick or
playing with a jumping rope. The wore dirty clothes, which after
having spent a week in Africa did not surprise me any more, because
even we got pretty dirty within a day without playing in the dirt.
Most of the kids however seemed to be on the way to or from school,
walking in groups in their school uniforms. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><IMG SRC="diary_africa_html_m2eaea7a5.gif" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=627 HEIGHT=471 BORDER=0>The
fact that we were arriving to a settlement was made noticeable by
speed bumps, so that the cars would slow down. Nevertheless it had
only a transient effect on the speed of our bus, because after the
bumps the speed rose again and some more aggressive honking started.
Between the settlements the landscape was pretty much the same until
Arusha: very dry red soil scattered Acacia trees of different species
some with bright yellow bark and bushes. It was surprising how dry
and burned out everything was, considering that the rainy season
should just have ended a few weeks before. As we were told later
there has been a drought and not much precipitation occurred during
the rainy season. So the area was in serious problem due to the lack
of water. The Kenyan newspapers were painting a dark future for
agricultural products and were already reporting about famine in
certain areas of the country. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">To my greatest disappointment we saw
absolutely no wild animals along the road. This is definitely not
what I have expected. On the other hand we saw many many cattle and
goats, mingled with some sheep, herded mostly by kids along the road,
looking for something eatable. No question it was a tough task as all
the grass was burned out. No wonder the animals were so lean. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Finally we reached to Tanzanian
border, de-registered from Kenya and applied for a Tanzanian visa.
Again the visa application was only about paying 50 USD, nothing
more. Everybody in the bus gave the passports, the money and the
application forms to the driver who gave it to the immigration
officers and in about half an hour all 20 people got their stamps.
After a few hours of bumpy ride we finally arrived to Arusha. The
traffic was quite crazy, there was no rule on the streets concerning
the right of way, people were simply driving and honking. So the
traffic jams were probably due to this kind of driving habit and not
to the number of the cars. From the shuttle terminal we took a cab to
the Arusha backpackers hostel, where we booked a double room in
advance. It was located on the main road, about 10 minutes walk away
from the centre of the town, which was marked by a clock tower
(sponsored by coca cola). It turns out that the location of the clock
tower marked the centre of the African continent as well, at least
what the distance between Cairo and Cape Town was concerned. In town
there was pretty much nothing to see. The most interesting thing was
probably the Masai market, where the carvings, spears, jewels and
paintings were sold. We looked around there, but did not buy
anything. The salesmen were very friendly, invited us in to their
sheds, showed us how they carve, paint, make bead ornaments etc. Even
though we told them that we are not going to buy anything. It
appeared that the carvings were mainly of hard wood like ebony,
mahogany and rose wood. As these trees grow very slowly and only for
these carvings yearly 60 000 trees are cut down, the environmentalist
suggest not to buy these carvings, but to ask for ones which are made
of fast growing trees like olive and mango. Nevertheless the value of
the carvings seems to lie in the material and not in the carving
itself. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">On the streets the stalkers
overwhelmed us. Their approach was quite polite, first they always
greeted us and started talking to us, asking where we are from, how
we are, where we are staying, have we been to Africa before etc.
After a short conversation they started pulling out bracelets,
necklaces, pictures made of banana leaves and other original
Tanzanian souvenirs out of their pockets to sell us for a very cheap
price. Other people started promoting safari offices for us.
Interestingly when we mentioned that we have a Kili climb booked with
Duma Explorer every single local said that it was a very nice
company. Again this surprised me, because in the guide books all you
can read that stalkers would tell you that the company you booked
your safari with does not even exist any more or that they offer bad
service and offer you a much better and cheaper company. At the
beginning we tried to be polite and act interested, but as we found
out it was a bad strategy because it only made it more difficult to
get rid of those people. We also found it out that we must not buy
anything from street vendors because they are pretty shameless and
sell e.g. free city maps for 12 USD. We were very pleased for a while
by buying a city map and a Swahili phrase book for 5 USD instead of
24. Then we found out that the map is for free and the phrase book is
about 1.25 USD. This was the point when we stopped buying things on
the street and asking the price. Basically the idea is that people on
the street want to rip you off as much as possible and you must
bargain without shame. Only then can you get things for a reasonable
price. Beside the street vendors there are many people hanging out on
the street offering guiding and taxi services. They want to show you
around in town, although there is not much to see or take you to the
“once in a year Masai market” which actually takes place almost
daily. Due to these disturbances walking in the city is quite
cumbersome and slow. We felt intimidated by the questions of the
locals, so we made up a story that we are from Finland and our names
are Mati and Tina. Then it turned out that half of Arusha's
population has relatives living in Finland.... I did not even take
pictures, because we were most of the time surrounded by people. We
were also told that taking photos in Africa in general is not so easy
because some people take it as an offense or they demand money for
their pictures, particularly people who dress up in the traditional
clothes for tourists. According to some organizations the latter
behavior should not be supported – although this made me think. In
Europe we have so many “street artist” who dress up like statutes
and just stand still and want money for their performance. And we
give money to those. On the other hand in Africa why is it wrong to
give money to poor people who put on their traditional costumes for
tourists. What is the difference? I bet in Europe those people could
make money by proper work, while in Africa the tribal people cannot
do too much to support their families, especially when weather
conditions are extreme and droughts occur. At least what they are
doing even has some cultural value, so I do not really see why it is
frowned upon…. for the tribal people it must be more difficult to
find jobs, as their level of education is not so high. In Arusha for
example the proud Masai warriors act as security guards for banks and
exchange offices and for other shops. In front of most buildings
armed guards are hanging out. In the Kilimanjaro area the climbing
companies used to employ only Chagga people as guides and porters
(they are the aborigines of the Kili area). Making a living otherwise
must be difficult, although it seemed that people are trying hard. As
most of the people are farmers they are trying to sell their products
and they do that everywhere. In the towns on the markets on the
streets, really everywhere. Every 10 meters there is somebody
standing on the street selling something: charcoaled corn on the cob,
oranges, mangos, peanuts, onions etc… Other people stocked up
mobile phones, DVDs (pirate copies of course), watches, phone
chargers. So actually all the settlements act as one huge
marketplace. I was simply wondering who is buying all these things?
Everybody is selling the same stuff…</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Concerning food we thought we would
not buy anything from the street, although “fast food” is sold
everywhere, meaning samosas, chapaties and other fried snacks which
are very cheap. The restaurants on the other hand are relatively
expensive, one meal costing 5-8000 Tanzanian shillings (4-7 USD). We
decided on eating in the hostel, since the price was more or less the
same as in other restaurants in town and the food was really good.
Kaarel loved their burgers and I really liked their vegetable stew.
Vegetarian dishes can be found everywhere because there are so many
vegetables available and because meat is quite expensive. The local
food is quite spicy, sometimes containing unusual things like cloves.
Even the local Swahili tea tastes very spicy and somehow it is savory
and fatty.

route</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Predeparture briefing took place the
day before our climb in Arusha backpackers. Our guide Msuri Moshi
talked to us in the bar and checked shortly our equipment. He gave us
a general introduction about the expected conditions, required
equipment etc. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">15.07.2009.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Pick up at the hotel by Duma
explorer at 9.00 am. In the van: driver, Msuri, the guide, our cook
Godwin and a porter named Rajabu. Ca 2h drive to the Machame gate.
Road was quite ok, asphalt, not like the one from Nairobi. Landscape
is manmade. Many buildings along the road, passing through smaller
villages, all of which seem to have a market all the way along the
road. 
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In front of the gate to the
Kilimanjaro National Park many local people were waiting, they were
either porters who wanted to be hired for a climb or were selling
gaiters, t-shirts etc to the tourists. We had to register at the
headquarters and we were ready for the climb.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">We waited until the bags of the
porters were weighed and until they organized the equipment. Before
starting the climb we met the crew: Msuri the head guide, Godwin the
cook, Oscar the waiter + porter, Emanuel the summit porter, Anderson
the tent responsible porter, Tadei , who was in charge for the toilet
and the other porters: Dickson, Godson, Jackson and Rajabu. So in
total we had 11 crew members for 2 climbers.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">On the Machame route there are no
huts or other facilities for the climbers or staff, so every group
had to carry their own tents, sleeping bags, kitchen equipment,
dishes etc. We were quite spoiled with a dining tent, camping chairs
and an own toilet tent. Our own bags were carried by the porters too,
we only needed to carry a small daypack with us, which contained
raingear, 2-3 l water/ person and lunch (+ personal things e.g.
camera, gps, cell phones).  Of course at the end it turned out that
we took too many things with us. When we were packing we took for
example one t-shirt for every day. It was really too much, because we
got dirty and sweaty almost immediately during the climb anyhow, so
it was not a problem to wear the same t-shirt every day. Particularly
because there was no showering possibility. We just had to change to
dry shirts after we were done with the climb for the day and  washed
our hands and feet. For cleaning the other body parts, taking wet
baby wipes was the best idea. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The climb started in a lush
rainforest-like mountain forest, with mossy trees, many ferns and
thick undergrowth.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">26.07.2009. Saturday</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Drove til 2 pm to Samburu national
reserve. Stopped for shopping at nanyuka, a small village at the foot
of Mt Kenya. Climbing tours are organized mainly from here. Campsite
is at the border of the national reserve on the bank of a river. Had
quick lunch at the campsite, put up the tents. Very windy, and dust
got swirled up. Visit to the Samburu village run by women who run
away from their man with their children, because of family violence
and because man in their community did not support girls attending
school, which they find very important. They are also against female
circumcision which is still practiced in their tribe. They founded
the village 20 years ago and are maintaining it by raising livestock,
giving tours to tourists, selling self made jewellery and they also
get financial support from outside. Their museum was supported by the
dutch. The museum displays a few every day items, spears, jewels,
girl skirt, apron, fat and milk containers, castrating tool, bow and
arrow which they use to take blood from their cows. Their main food
is milk and blood. They do not grow crops. The women also danced and
sang for us and with us. During the songs they were making movements
so their many bead necklaces would bounce up and down in their necks.
We were told that unmarried women wear beads of one color only and
after marriage they wear colorful ones. They also run a school for
their kids and for the kids of the surrounding settlements. There are
2 classes, one for babies up to 3-4 years and the other one for older
kids until they go to primary school. At school they learn 3
languages: their tribal Samburu, English and Swahili. We visited the
school too. The kids were very cute, they were singing in English and
were very friendly. Most of them had only dirty clothes and some of
them were naked in the bottom. One kid had a teletubies doll, the
other one was playing with a stick with a plastic wheel attached to
its end. We took many photos of them and showing the pictures to them
made them really happy. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">At the time of our visit the herd
was not at home, only the baby animals were left in the village. They
were all really thin. I guess they get only milk from their mothers
after they came back from grazing. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">At the end of our visit the women
presented us their goods for sale. They make jewelery out of beads:
bracelets, necklaces. They also had some carvings for sale , made by
their sons and spears too. We bought 2 necklaces for 750 Ksh = 10
USD. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I had cooking duty and our team made
chicken curry with rice, with the guidance of Moses, our tour leader.

left the doors of the tent open and used only the thin sleeping bag.

looked very fancy, had swimming pool, but they wanted to charge 850

water. Around the park Samburu people live in small settlements,
their houses are round and have no window. The roof is traditionally
made of cow dung, but nowadays they also use plastic bags and
cardboards. They keep the cows and goats in the middle of the village
surrounded by fence. They take them out grazing during the day. Kids
around the villages are cute, come to the tourist buses and wave.
