<h1>Jinja, 2009-07-31</h1> 

<p>In the morning rode a motorized boda-boda (pika-pika in Swahili) to Jinja.
It's a 20 minute ride, about 7km. Average fee is 3000 USh per person, but
from the 5000 bill the driver refuses to give back change (he claims that
he doesn't have any).</p>

<p>Jinja is a nice quiet town. Nobody is aggressively selling stuff to mzungus.
The houses are nicer than e.g. in Nakuru, Arusha, and other towns that
we have seen so far.</p>

<p>There are many banks: almost every second building along the Main
street is a bank. Banks are surrounded by a fence, and guarded by armed
guards. Exchange rates vary, our 40 USD is bought for 2060 USh per dollar.</p>

<p>We walk along the Main street, then downhill to the lake. Several
hotels by the lake, many run down, as if they have had better days (maybe
in the 60ies). We dine at Hotel Triangle: vegetable samosa (both), vegetables
and chapati + fanta (Cs), tilapia fillet with mashed potatoes + 2 x coke (K).
In total 23000, with tip 25000. (i.e. 17 USD).</p>

<p>Walk back to the center. Kids greet the mzungus and are happy when we want
to take a photo of them.</p>

<p>Meet some boda-boda guys and have them take us to the Nile Reflections
hotel (for 2 x 1000). On the way to Nile Reflections pass a huge fair ground.
Just a week ago an annual agriculture fair has ended.</p>

<p>Nile Reflections is a nice hotel on the hillside. Completely empty.
We walk down to the river, have coffee, and watch the kingfishers,
cormorants, and otters fishing. Two coffees: 7000 + 1000 (tip).</p>

<p>Walk back. Pass by an Indian temple with a monument of Mahatma Gandhi
in the yard. Apparently his ashes were placed into Nile. All the cleaners
and gardeners at the temple are black, some Indian women sit next to the temple,
some Indian men inside. We are allowed to look inside the temple (provided that
we take off our shoes) and take pictures. Uganda had a large Asian community
in the 60-70ies, but during the Amin times most were forced to leave.</p>

<p>Meet a group of boda-boda guys. Tell them that we want to go to the Nile
Explorer's campsite. They take us to the Nile Explorer backpackers just
approx. one km away. This is not what we want, the guys don't seem to know
where the campsite is, although I show them on the GPS that it's still 6km away.
Fortunately, yet another pair of boda-boda guys come who seem to know better
what we want. We change the vehicles, and pay the failed guys 1k although they
seem to want more.</p>

<p>We agree on 5k for both rides to the camp. Starts another bumpy, dusty and fun ride.</p>

<p>Total cost of the Jinja experience for two: 8k + 25k + 2k + 8k + 1k + 5k = 49k.</p>
