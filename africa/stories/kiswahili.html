<h1>Kiswahili</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Kiswahili is a language spoken in Kenya, Tanzania, and the eastern
part of Uganda. Some of the words and phrases of Kiswahili
have been made popular by the film "Lion King", e.g. <em>simba</em>, <em>hakuna matata</em>.
Many words are shared with Estonian (although unfortunately not in meaning), e.g.
<em>pesa</em>, <em>sita</em>, <em>haraka</em>, <em>kuu</em>.</p>

<h2>Personal dictionary</h2>

<p>The dictionary is given roughly in temporal order
of getting to know these words (but it can be reordered
by clicking on the column headers).</p>
