<title>Table Mountain Hike, 2009-10-08</title>

<h1>Table Mountain Hike, 2009-10-08</h1>

<p>Started at the hostel "The Backback".
Walked up along the road to the lower cable car station.
Quite crowded there (later it turned out that the
cable car was broken). Then along the road to the trailhead.</p>

<p>From there a steep 1.10h hike along the Platterklip Gorge.
Many hikers, some annoyingly loud.
No criminals although signs warn about them.</p>

<p>At the top the track splits, one can either walk to the upper
cable car station or to the Maclear's Beacon. The top is flat,
the surface is surprisingly swampy.</p>

<p>Most people go towards the cable car station (some 15 minutes away),
we start walking in the other direction towards the highest point.</p>

<p>The beacon is just a heap of stones. Nice views to the bay and the Robben
Island. We hear a signal which we think means that the cable car service
has been stopped, and decide to descend along the route that
leads through the Skeleton Gorge to the botanical gardens.</p>

<p>Nice <em>fynbos</em> vegetation and small waterfalls along the route.
The Skeleton Gorge is very steep and hiking is supported by ladders.
People are advised not to take this route in rainy weather. For us
the weather is dry and even sunny at times.</p>

<p>After approx. an hour in the gorge reach the back entrance to the botanical gardens.
Nobody asks for the entrance fee, it seems that people who have bothered to
enter the gardens over the mountain get a free entrance.</p>

<pre>
Trip odometer: 13.5km

</pre>

<p>Eat french fries (as elsewhere in Africa, these are
actually called "chips") at the
Kirstenbosch Tea Room. Two guineafowl walk by. Feed
one of them. Guinefowl is quite scary if experienced
at such close proximity.</p>

<p>Spend an hour in the garden. Too tired to focus on the plants.
Fail to locate the <em>fynbos</em> section, although it's shown
on the map.</p>

<p>Share a cab with two Italians back to town. The Italians
participate in the gynecology conference (FIGO 2009) that is currently
happening in Cape Town. They live in what seems to be the best hotel
in town. As they don't speak any English it's time consuming
to arrange the shared ride and later get them to pay their
half of the price.</p>

<p>Later the cab takes us back to The Backpack
where we meet the last three remaining Abs. Africa members who
are just leaving Cape Town on a rented car on their way to some
place that offers shark cage diving, and then to Joburg (?).</p>
