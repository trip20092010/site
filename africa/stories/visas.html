<!--
<p>Obtaining the visa at the border always goes smoothly, maybe
because we travel with an overlanding company. Applying for the
the Malawi, Namibia and RSA visas is a pain. The Malawi embassy
almost loses our passports, the Namibia and RSA embassies
refuse the start processing the applications until late July,
couple of weeks before our trip starts. The reason is that the visa
would expire by the time we reach Namibia/RSA (i.e. in 90 days).</p>
