<h1>Surprises in Asia</h1>

<p>The following is a list of things that surprised Kaarel during the Asian leg of the trip.</p>

<div class="day">
<h2>2010-05-15</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Local fascination with tourists</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1260616.JPG" title="Posing with an Indonesian baby"/>
</div>
<p>Indonesian people like to have their picture taken
while posing next to a tourist. While visiting the Monas tower in Jakarta
we were approached by 4 or 5 different groups of people (mostly
schoolchildren) who wanted the to have their picture taken standing
next to us. One man even asked Csilla to pose while holding his baby.</p>

<p>The reasons behind this fascination have remained largely unclear to us:
is it that foreigners are unusually tall, have unusually pale complexion
(even after spending 6 months in tropical countries), wear funny hats, or
have facial hair? Or does it bring good luck if one is featured on the same
picture with a foreigner. (Note that Asian people do all kinds of weird things
in the hope for good luck: release caged birds, feed fish, burn paper money,
etc.)</p>

<p>The above picture is taken in Prambanan a couple of days after the surprise.
Here we were already used to being the object of locals' photography.</p>

<h3>Gunung Bromo and a Hindu religious ceremony</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1260936.JPG"
title="Tenggerese women praying towards Gunung Bromo"/>
</div>
<p>Mount Bromo sits in the Tengger caldera, next to [BUG: how many]
other volcanoes and a Hindu temple. The local people have been throwing
offerings (plus what seems to be regular garbage) into the
caldera making it look a bit like a garbage can. After seeing some 10
volcano craters during this trip, Gunung Bromo is finally a one
that smokes: a huge column of sulfurous smoke rises out of the
pit.</p>

<p>We arrived at the base of Gunung Bromo right at the beginning
of an annual religious ceremony [BUG: what was the name?]. The local
Tenggerese people constitute of small pocket of Hindus that remained
after Muslims spread all over Java
(other Hindus went to the Bali island). The temple was crowded inside
and outside surrounded with vehicles.
Everybody had come either in a jeep or on a motorbike.</p>

<p>The ceremony was quite short, 1h at most.
It consisted of some sitting and
praying (men and women where sitting in the separate parts of the
temple), accompanied by some singing and (mainly) percussion music.
In the end the priests sprinkled the participants with holy (?) water.
Most people then rushed away, but some stayed to eat. Some
of the food was placed in front of the holy statues. We offered one of our biscuits
to Ganesh, the remover of obstacles. (Not sure if it was polite
or appropriate.)</p>

<h3>Loud thunder</h3>
<p>Tubing down the Bohorok river to the village of Bukit Lawang
heard a loud thunder sound which surprised because so
loud thunder I had never heard before.</p>

<p>It thunders and rains around Bukit Lawang almost every evening,
at least in May.</p>

<p>Fish fighting over food, people feeding them with bread (and not fishing them),

<!--
Lonely Planet:
Join the novice monks and other children as they sprinkle tiny pellets of fish food
(which are sold on the pier) into the river at
Tha Thewet, transforming the muddy river into a brisk
boil of flapping bodies.
-->

<p>It is also possible to buy little fish, frogs and turtles and release
them into the river (for good luck?).</p>

<p>I had seen feeding of the fish in São Paulo, Galapagos, Georgetown, etc.
and was always surprised by the concentration of fish that is causes, but
the fish of Bangkok take it to a whole new level.</p>

<h3>Weird law restricting the sale of alcohol</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1340647.JPG" title="Alcohol unavailable, 7-eleven"/>
</div>
<p>Tried to buy a bottle of wine at 16 o'clock in Bangkok, but it turned
out that wine (any alcohol?) can be sold only 11.00-14.00
and 17.00-midnight, unless you want to buy 10 liters.
(Tried in the ChinaCentral (?) supermall and in a 7-eleven.)
Don't know what is the motivation behind this law...</p>

<p>The above photo was taken 2 months after the first surprise
when I was not surprised anymore but simply annoyed.</p>

<h3>Wax sculptures of famous Buddhist monks</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1290338.JPG" title="Wax sculpture of a famous Buddhist monk"/>
</div>
<p>The wax sculptures in the Thai Human Imagery Museum
are extremely lifelike, especially the sculptures of the
famous Buddhist monks (about 15 sculptures) on the first floor.
Little details like wrinkles, birth marks and spots on the skin,
blood vessels under the skin, etc. have been carefully carved into
the sculptures.</p>

<p>I hadn't really seen good wax sculptures before, e.g. I've never
visited the Madam Tussaud's museums.</p>

<h3>Second-hand bookstores in Chiang Mai</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1290661.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>Many bookstores.
Wide selection: not just travel guides, mainstream novels, and spiritual literature,
but also e.g. popular science. Several shelves even for Finnish books.
A bit expensive though, on average books cost about 200&ndash;300 THB.
Photocopies of Lonely Planet cost 150 THB (new original is 950 THB). How did this
second-hand bookstore scene emerge in Chiang Mai, of all places?</p>

abundant.</p>

<h3>Water puppet performance</h3>
<p>1h show at the Water Puppet Theater, mostly for the
tourists. Ticket price 40k or 60k. The 10 puppeteers who are not
visible during the performance.
Band includes more string instruments
than a gamelan band (e.g. single-stringed zither, <em>dan bau</em>).
Puppets include buffalo, villagers, frogs, fish,
lions, king Le Loi, giant golden turtle,
boats, ducks, fairies,
and the four Holy Animals (unicorn, phoenix, dragon, turtle).
Unfortunately missed the most technical move (was focused on the band instead)
&mdash; King Le Loi
handing the magic sword back to the Giant Golden Turtle.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Hanoi traffic</h3>
<p>There is no subway or SkyRail in Hanoi. No public buslines [BUG: check].
Instead everybody owns a motorbike.
Streets are filled with a continuous flow of motorbikes; zebra crossings and
even traffic lights are not respected; constant honking, for
no apparent reason; side walks are used as motorbikes' parking space,
so there is no place for pedestrians.
Worst during Saturday evening in the Old Quarter.</p>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Tide</h3>
<p>Spent the night in a small resort on a small island near the Cat Ba island.
The resort was a row of bungalows squeezed between a 30-meter vertical cliff
and a short strip of sand by a small bay.</p>
<p>In the evening observed the tide getting stronger with water covering the sandy beach
completely,
in the next morning all of the water had been sucked out of the bay.
Locals were collecting mussels from the bottom of the bay.</p>
<p>[BUG: learn about the possible tide cycles]</p>
<p>Wikipedia: Ha Long Bay has the typical diurnal tide system (tide amplitude ranges from 3.5-4m).</p>
<!--
Spent one afternoon, one full day, and one morning in the Halong Bay.
During the first day it was high tide: one couldn't the "tide stripes"
on the outcrops, second day started with a low tide (stripes were there),
but by sunset it was high tide (water covered sandy beaches by the cliffs)
but the strips were still there. Third day was probably the lowest tide.
[BUG: does this cycle make sense]
-->
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Bus with beds</h3>
<p>Took an overnight bus from Hanoi to Hue. Instead
of seats, the bus had beds.
There were 6 rows of 3 columns of 2 layers of beds + bed space for about
6 people in the very back, i.e. 42 places in total.
When entering the bus one has to take the shoes off.
Also, the bigger daypacks are not allowed on the
bus. Had to argue long with the bus driver to be allowed
to take my bag on board. First I though this rule is there to make sure that
the aisles are kept free e.g. so that people can easily go to the toilet at the
back of the bus. Later
it turned out that the bus, which was scheduled to make just one stop between
Hanoi and Hue, actually stopped at every village to pick up people who
would then sit/sleep in the aisle. Bus drivers' way to earn some extra money.</p>

<p>Otherwise it was quite comfortable: could sleep better than in a South-American
long-distance bus.</p>

<h3>Tailor scene in Hoi An</h3>
<p>Every second house in the old town of Hoi An hosts a tailor shop.
You can have your measurements taken for a fancy suit or dress, or immediately
buy a fake Lacoste polo-shirt, as cheap as 4 USD. T-shirts with
Vietnamese motifs cost 2 USD.</p>
<p>Similar tailor scene exists in the touristy area of Banglamphu in Bangkok,
but in Hoi An the concentration of tailor shops is much bigger.</p>

<p>Monday morning 10 o'clock traffic in front of
the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Worse than Indonesia and Vietnam (honking!)
combined. An army of cute yellow-and-black taxicabs. Double-decker buses.
Large crowds of people, mostly men.
And a cow in the middle of all this.</p>

<h3>Indian transvestites</h3>
<p>Two transvestites walking around in the Ahmedabad&ndash;Mumbai train, clapping
their hands and touching peoples heads. Didn't understand the purpose of this,
maybe was a form of begging although I didn't see anybody giving them money.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Flooding in Mumbai</h3>
<p>Took a taxi from the Dadar train station to the airport.
It was raining heavily and some of the streets were flooded
to the extent that people were walking knee-deep in the water.
The buses that were passing by created major waves, locally
rising the water levels even further.
Viewed this all from the cozy air-conditioned taxi.</p>

<p>The Mathematics-section of the Hong Kong Science Museum

a cross by metal rods (not visible), the task was to take
to cross apart.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1350313.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>The solution was simply to spin the cross to
move the rods (4) to the 4 ends of the cross
breaking the connection in the middle. This cannot
be achieved in any other way (e.g. by shaking the
cross).</p>

<h3>Hong Kong dollar paper notes</h3>
<p>Visited the museum of Hong Kong Monetary Authority on the 55th floor of ifc two
(this beautiful skyscraper has 88 floors in total but only the 55th is accessible
to tourists)
and learned that Hong Kong dollar paper notes are issued by 3 different
note-issuing banks, each using a different design.
The 93/94-designs were updated in 2003 (the 1000-note has received
even 3 updates since 93/94) but the old notes were not demonetized.
This has lead to the confusing situation that 40 different notes are used
to represent 6 different nominations (10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000).</p>
