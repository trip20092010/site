<h1>Thai</h1> 

<div class="wip">Work in progress!</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thai is a language that uses a script remote from any script that we
are familiar with (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic). Thailand is the first country
on our trip that predominantly uses a script alien to us.</p>

<!--<p>(Not counting obscure
languages like Karo Batak and languages with not much official status
in the countries what we have so far been e.g. Javanese, Chinese.)</p>-->

<p>In many places in Thailand, the text is presented only in Thai script.
Ordering food or even finding an accommodation for the night can turn out
to be quite a challenge.</p>

</div>

<p>I tried to grasp the basics of the Thai script by watching karaoke
DVDs in the public long-distance buses (where you have no other choice anyway)
where the lyrics were presented both in the Thai script and in some
sort of Latin transcription. Didn't get anywhere with this approach...</p>

<h2>Script</h2>

<p>Picture of the Thai alphabet where each
consonant is assigned an acrophonic Thai word,
e.g. ท = ทหาร (soldier).</p>

<h3>Phatthalung</h3>

<p>First word the writing of which I learned was "Phatthalung" (name of a town in
southern Thailand).</p>

<p>This word can be written in various (calligraphically different) ways
on the street signs and buses/trains.</p>

<h3>ผัดไทย</h3>

<p>Pad Thai (or Phat Thai). This word which stands
for a popular Thai dish can be seen
in the menu in every street restaurant in Thailand.</p>


<h3>Digits</h3>

<p>The digits in Thai script are different from the digits in Latin script,
some however are misleadingly similar, i.e. they look like Latin
digits but stand for a different number (e.g. <span class="big">๑</span> looks like '9' but stands for 1).
Fortunately, in most places (incl. the money)
the numbers are written also in Latin script.</p>


<h3>ทีวี</h3>

<p>Means "TV" and is probably pronounced as the English "TV" i.e. /ti:vi:/.</p>

WO WAEN + SARA II

<h2>Personal dictionary</h2>

<p>The Thai script is such a big obstacle that one doesn't
learn many words/phrases during a couple of weeks in Thailand.</p>

<!--
<p>The dictionary is given roughly in temporal order
of getting to know these words (but it can be reordered
by clicking on the column headers). The dictionary was mostly
learned by looking at the street signs and ads. Words
which were overheard might have a misspelling in the
following table.</p>
-->

<p>The transcription in the following table is based on
"Rough Guide to South East Asia" (2002), but the tone markers are omitted.</p>
