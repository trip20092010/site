<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Enormous amount of motorbikes.</B>
Our guide said: no motorbike, no girlfriend. In the cities on every
street there is a continuous flow of bikers. As a friend of ours
pointed out they behave as one organism,   like a shoal of fish: if
there is an obstacle on the road, e.g. a car stopping or a pedestrian
crossing the road, the bikers just flow around it without slowing
down, god forbid stopping. Most of them have 2 passengers, but the
whole family (2 adults and 2 kids) travelling on one bike is very
common too. Helmet is obligatory (only for locals - foreigners do not
even need a license we were told, as police would not stop them), but
the trendy ones most people are wearing, that look like a baseball
hat, are probably not of much use in the case of an accident.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the high number of bikers, they
usually take up the whole road, driving in several parallel rows. Of
course the consequence is a terrible amount of honking by the car and
bus drivers and a slow pace traffic (max 50-60 km/h) everywhere.
Honking is most horrible in the big cities where the streets are
narrow. Usually even if there is a pedestrian area next to the road
it is blocked by vendors or parked motorbikes, so one has to walk on
the road, very close to the moving vehicles. The worst thing is when
a bus drives by and blows the horn... It does not only make you jump,
but causes temporal deafness as well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Women crazy about white skin. </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">They
are very afraid of getting a tan. It w</SPAN>ould make them look like
peasants who work in the fields all day. Funny enough even peasants
who work in the field all day do everything to avoid a tan. In the
middle of the biggest heat and most humid environment they all wear
long sleeved clothes, wide brim hats (the typical conical hats are
everywhere in the cities and in the fields), gloves, face masks that
are usually large enough to cover their neck. They even invented the
two toed socks that one can wear comfortably with a flip flop. In the
stores the skin moisturizers have bleach in them. On the beaches we
have seen locals only around sunrise or sunset. In Na Thrang the
beach was full at 6 am (people participating in aerobic classes,
doing exercise on the shore, sitting around in the water), but almost
completely empty around 8 am. Women usually swim in their clothes,
t-shirts and below knee pants. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Women in pants.</B> Quite
interesting that women always wear pants. I do not remember seeing
anybody in skirts. The typical female outfit is the pijama like
dress, consisting of a light long-sleeved jacket with buttons and
with large patterns and a matching pair of pants without pockets. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Unfriendly people. P</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">eople
are quite unfriendly and rude compared to their welcoming neighbors.</SPAN>
It seemed that people, foreigner or local are treated like a piece of
meat, they are pushed around on the streets, dragged into buses
against their wills, stuffed into buses even if there is no space
left and shouted at in restaurants. In the southern parts the
Vietnamese get much friendlier though.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Food is not that special in most
parts of the country</B> (Hoi An is an exception), as similar food is
found in the neighboring countries as well. We had the most horrible
meal of our entire journey here, right on the first day. We found it
hard to find acceptable restaurants, because the food stalls on the
streets and most of the small local eateries did not look appetizing
and many were stinky. We had no such problem in Thailand, Laos or
Malaysia and ate street food with the locals. Vietnam was the only
country where we threw away the food we bought on the street. It does
not have to be mentioned that the term vegetarian is unknown, even if
you say in Vietnamese: “an chay” confuses the locals and they
keep offering you and putting meat into your food. In the cities
there are fancy restaurants and cafes, but these were clearly over
our budget (making you pay 25,000 dong for a 500 cc water when it
costs less than 5000 even in the tourist shops). In our low budget
restaurants (around 40 000 dong for a dish: equals about 2 USD) food
was not memorable. It has to be added however that I had the best
vegi spring rolls in Hue and Kaarel the best Zurcher Geschnetzeltes
with rosti in Can Tho (in our experience Italian and other Western
food is not a good choice in South America and Asia).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Lack of grocery stores.</B> It was
our <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">other food related problem.
</SPAN>There are only small shops run by families selling cookies,
drinks, chips and toiletries, but all at arbitrary prices. We found
grocery stores only in Na Thrang and in Saigon and there we have
realized that the prices are actually low, only the local vendors
want to make big money by selling even water for the double price.
Our favorite cookies cost 28 000 dong in the store and everywhere up
to 60 000 at the local shops.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Architecture is quite interesting.</B>
Surprisingly there are many many huge villa-like very fancy houses
everywhere, even on the countryside (I thought Vietnam was still a
poor country). If the space is small then the houses are slim and
they build the houses tall, like in Holland. There are not so many
colonial buildings. Dalat was particularly disappointing, because the
Lonely Planet is raving about this city as being full of colonial
houses, but to us it looked like any other city and we had
difficulties spotting those French houses. In Saigon in the narrow
alleys we could peek into the homes of the locals as they keep the
doors to their ground floor facilities wide open during the day. It
seemed that most of the daily activities take place on that floor. It
is usually just one room with tiles on the floor and on the walls. 
They cook here, they eat here, they nap here during the day (on the
floor or in hammocks), they raise the kids here and watch TV here
too.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Sanitation is similar to the other
South East Asian countries:</B> garbage everywhere, locals throwing
trash on the streets or on the floor of the restaurants even if there
are trash cans next to them, sewage water flowing on the street in
semi-covered tubes and emptied in to the creeks and rivers, probably
without much treatment. In the Mekong Delta and Halong Bay garbage
floating on the water is a common sight. In the former there are huge
garbage piles on the shore and under the houses built on stilts.
Still people are washing the dishes, the clothes, their bodies and
their teeth in the Mekong, next to the garbage. I do not even want to
know what happens with the household sewage. I doubt there is a
proper canalization system tough... We were told that the locals are
used to these hygienic standards, so they do not get diarrhea very
often. For drinking they collect rain water though.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>English skills.</B> On the gringo
trail almost every local can say at least 2 sentences in English:
”Only one dollar” and “very cheap ...”. Usually their
vocabulary ends here and one cannot communicate with most of the
people beyond this. Even people in the tourist industry, including
many guides, tour agents, hotel receptionists and waiters whose
English sounds very impressive first can often not answer even a
simple question. As if they had memorized a few complex phrases, but
it appeared to us that their listening comprehension is often poor.
