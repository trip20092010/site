<h1>Yogyakarta</h1>

<h2>Understand</h2>

<p>Yogyakarta (also Jogja) is a town in the middle of the Java island.
It is quite touristic, offering a lot to see and do in and around the town
(e.g. Borobudur, Prambanan, Ramayana ballet, Sultan's Palace, shopping for batik).
The climate can be very muggy in May.</p>

<h2>Get in</h2>

<p>Take a 8h train from Jakarta. The train is quite comfortable
and there is a wide selection of food (for extra charge).
In the beginning the radio plays the song "I'm a barbie girl"
by the group Aqua, repeating it
again and again for 30 minutes or so. It's very irritating,
but eventually they stop.
Look out of the window and enjoy views to the rice fields.</p>

<h2>Get around</h2>

<div class="ad">
<img src="../images/P1260704.JPG" title="Becak on the road"/>
</div>

<p>The main sight in Jogja &mdash; Kraton &mdash; is probably in walking
distance from the hotel where you are staying, but it's more fun
to go there and to other places by a <em>becak</em> (bicycle taxi) or
an <em>andong</em> (horse-drawn carriage).</p>

<p>Much cheaper are city buses but their destinations and schedules
are (probably) difficult to find out. They have elevated bus stops which
look quite new and modern.</p>

<p>For the out-of-town sites (such as Borobudur and Prambanan) consider
joining an organized tour.</p>

<h3>Becak</h3>

<p>Becak is a 3-wheel bicycle with the driver on the
back and the passenger(s) sitting in the front in a big basket
with a roof. Yogyakarta is a relatively flat city, in only
a few occasions must the driver climb off his seat and start pushing.
Should one come out of the basket then and help him push,
or would it harm his reputation?</p>

<p>A 10 minute becak ride can cost anything between
<span class="cost_idr">3000</span>
and
<span class="cost_idr">15000</span>, depending on your bargaining
skills. It's very easy to bargain though as there are many becaks around
(most drivers just sleep all day in the passenger basket, seemingly
never having any customers), and you can alternatively take an
<em>andong</em> or just walk.</p>

<h2>See/Do</h2>

<h3>Borobudur and Prambanan</h3>

<p>One of the most impressive temples anywhere in the world
are just an hour's drive from Jogja. The Buddhist temple Borobudur
and the Hindu temple Prambanan were both built around the 9th century
and now after being re-discovered and re-built are UNESCO World Heritage
sites. Tour agencies offer various tours to see both or either
one of these temples.</p>

<p>For example, the 9h tour which visits both temples starts at 5am
with a drive to Borobudur reaching there at the opening time of 6am
(before the schoolchildren arrive). One has then about 2h to visit the
temple after which breakfast is had and the tour continues to
Mendut where the largest statue of Buddha (in Indonesia?) is
in a small temple. A 1.5h drive then follows to Prambanan.
It is possible to visit a silver processing shop to take a break
from the drive. At Prambanan one has another 2h before the tour
returns to Jogja.
The price of such a trip is <span class="cost_idr">310000</span> (including the entrance
tickets to Borobudur and Prambanan, and a small breakfast at Borobudur).</p>

<p>This 9h tour feels a bit rushed. Both sites
deserve a bit longer time especially since a lot of time is spent
on practicing English with local visiting students. Also, just
walking from the gate (parking lot)
to the actual temple (and coming back afterward) takes a considerable
time. Therefore, consider spending a separate day on each site.</p>

<h3>Kraton / Sultan's Palace</h3>

<p>The visit to the Sultan's Palace (entry <span class="cost_idr">12500</span>;
"Fotograf and video permit except Batik museum" <span class="cost_idr">1000</span>) includes a gamelan+puppet show
and entry to various small museums: batik museum (photography is not allowed
for some reason), Sultan's porcelain collection, etc.
One does not learn much as all the descriptions are in Indonesian (and Javanese?).
Judging by the photos and paintings, Sultan likes to wear pointy ear
decorations, reminding a bit the elves from Lord of the Rings. Why?</p>

<h3>Pakualaman Palace</h3>

<p>Pakualaman is a smaller kind of sultan (also wears elvish ears).
Need to research its function more on Wikipedia,
the adjacent museum had all the descriptions in local languages.
Donation is expected. The guards are friendly and don't speak any English.</p>

<h3>Biology Museum</h3>

<p>The Biology Museum (entry for an outrageous <span class="cost_idr">10000</span>)
not far from the Pakualaman Palace
displays
many stuffed local animals, incl. <em>Cynocephalus variegatus</em> (Malaysian Flying Lemur).
There is also a skeleton of a dugong.</p>

<h3>Bird market</h3>

<div class="ad">
<img src="../images/P1260766.JPG" title="Caged bats"/>
</div>

<p>The Bird Market has recently been relocated to Jl. Batul, some 4km away from the center.
According to the locals, the sultan will use the previous location (which is
right next to the palace) to build a fancy hotel.</p>

<p>The new bird market is large and clean. Many different birds and cages
are traded.
<!--
(It seems that the local custom is to keep birds as pets.)
-->
In addition to birds, also many
geckos, bats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, dogs, crickets, snakes, worms have been stuck into
tiny cages. The bats are the most impressive, hanging either from their feet or their wings
from the ceiling of the cages.</p>

<h3>Puppet factory</h3>

<p>Shows the production of these flat shadow puppets that one can also see in
the Wayang Museum in Jakarta.
One artist cuts the figure out of the buffalo skin and makes the holes, the
other paints, the third one attaches the stick to the back and to the hands
of the figure.</p>

<h3>Batik shop</h3>

<p>Sooner or later you will end up in a batik-shop. Better ones serve you jasmine tea,
show the batik-technique, and demonstrate that the paint does not come off if you wash the
canvas. Only then do they offer you the "best price" and make you feel obliged to buy
something.
More established places show you the prices
up front. The prices range from <span class="cost_idr">30000</span> to <span class="cost_idr">1000000</span>.
Student work is cheaper, teachers charge more.
Also, the price depends on the amount of colors and detail.
Size doesn't matter that much.</p>

<h3>Ramayana performance</h3>

<p>During the dry season months, the Ramayana story is told via an open air ballet
taking place after sunset at the Prambanan temples. Tour agencies offer the ticket and transport
to Prambanan for <span class="cost_idr">110000</span> (for the cheapest seats).</p>

<p>The story itself is boring &mdash; two guys (a good guy and a bad guy) fight over
a woman. The bad guy starts it by stealing the woman from the good guy,
but the good guy (helped by a white monkey called Hanuman) eventually wins. It would
be impossible to follow the story unless you know it already (at the entrance
gate you can pick up a sheet of paper with the synopsis).</p>

<p>The costumes and make-up of the actors are beautiful. Their dance is interesting,
sometimes resembling the robot-style break dance. Their arrow shooting skills are
excellent: fights are performed with real bows and arrows which are shot to hit the target
from some 20m away.</p>

<p>Hope that it doesn't rain, as then the performance would be taken indoors and one
would lose the background of the Prambanan temples.</p>


<h3>Malioboro Mall</h3>

<p>The Malioboro Mall is a large Western-style
mall with escalators, ATMs, air-conditioning and food courts.
If you run out of ideas of what to do in Jogja then
you can always visit the Malioboro Mall and play
Dance Dance Revolution.</p>

<h3>Kaliurang</h3>

<p>If your last name is only a small edit distance away
from the name of this highland resort then
consider visiting it.</p>


<h2>Buy</h2>

<p>Buy water and drink it (see also the <a href="#Drink">Drink</a> and
<a href="#Stay_healthy">Stay healthy</a> sections) in order not
to de-hydrate.</p>

<p>Every local seems to want you to buy a batik.
But don't buy it unless you really want to.</p>

<h2>Eat</h2>

<p>There are loads of restaurants and food stalls. The cheapest are
street vendors who offer a <em>bakso</em>-soup or chicken-satay for just <span class="cost_idr">2000</span>,
but the whole environment around them looks a bit dirty. The main dishes in
the cheaper tourist-oriented restaurants are between
<span class="cost_idr">15000</span> and <span class="cost_idr">25000</span>.
The food court at the Malioboro Mall is a tiny bit cheaper.</p>

<p>The food is the standard Indonesian food: <em>nasi goreng</em> (fried rice),
<em>mie goreng</em> (fried noodles), with <em>ayam</em> (chicken)
<em>sapi</em> (beef), or <em>tahu</em> (tofu), etc. The tourist-oriented restaurants also offer
Western food (burgers, spaghetti, pizza) but it's more expensive,
(probably) not as good as in the West, and as the local food is tasty
it hardly makes sense to eat the Western food (unless you are really bored
with the <em>nasi goreng</em> or are interested how they prepare <em>r&ouml;sti</em>).</p>

<p><b>Bedhot Resto</b> is located in Gang 2 at Jalan Sosrowijayan.
Mostly tourists come. Seems to be cheaper than other tourist-oriented
places at Jl. Sosrowijayan. Serves beer (<span class="cost_idr">20000</span> during Happy Hour).</p>

<p><b>Siomay Jakarta Kang Ujang</b> is located at the old bird market, between the Sultan's Palace
and the Water Castle.
One can compose his/her own meal
by picking out items of food (each item <span class="cost_idr">1000</span>) from a set of pots.
The choice includes prawns,
squid, potatoes, tofu, and rolls of cabbage and beans. The selection
is deep-fried if wished and served together with a plate of peanut sauce.
Delicious.
The owner visited Oulu, Finland for 4 months 11 years ago.
So if you decide to introduce yourself as coming from Finland be prepared
to converse on topics ranging from sauna and <em>grillimakkara</em>
to <em>kirputori</em> and ice fishing.</p>

<a name="Drink"></a>
<h2>Drink</h2>

<p>Drink bottled water that is sold at every street corner.
Price for 1.5l ranges from
<span class="cost_idr">3000</span> to
<span class="cost_idr">8000</span>.</p>

<p>Most restaurants offer cheap and tasty fruit juices.
It's not clear where their water and ice come from, but it
seems to be OK.</p>

<p>A 500ml bottle of the local Bintang beer costs at least <span class="cost_idr">20000</span>,
i.e. even more than a main dish in a tourist-oriented restaurant.
The price is the same in a store and in a restaurant.
Drink it never-the-less.</p>

<h2>Sleep</h2>

<p>There are numerous hotels, especially around Jalan Sosrowijayan.
One option is Hotel Merbabu, where <span class="cost_idr">130000</span> can get you a double
room including a bathroom (cold water), a fan, WiFi, and breakfast.
The WiFi signal barely
reaches your room, the reception is better at the rooftop terrace
where breakfast is served. As the climate is hot and humid, consider
upgrading to a room with a proper AC.</p>

<a name="Stay_healthy"></a>
<h2>Stay healthy</h2>

<p>Jogja can be very hot and humid making you sweat like
a pig. You must constantly drink water to stay hydrated.</p>

<p>Entering air-conditioned rooms (e.g. the Malioboro Mall)
while covered with sweat can make you easily catch cold.
Always carry a thick fleece with you and wear it if needed.</p>

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

<p>Yogyakarta feels very safe, also after sunset. Locals
often talk to you in an attempt to drag you into a batik
shop, but you can politely refuse to go.</p>

<p>Traffic is horrible. Take care when you cross the road.</p>

<h2>Get out</h2>

<p>One popular option is to take a 10h shuttle bus to see the Bromo
volcano.
The price of such a trip is <span class="cost_idr">160000</span>.</p>
