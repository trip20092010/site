The trip is now officially over in the sense that we have arrived in one of our homelands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today has been relatively uneventful: woke up at 5 o'clock being still in the Beijing timezone, went grocery shopping at 9 (they open the Konsum across the street that late), wanted to buy&lt;i&gt; tatar&lt;/i&gt; to prepare &lt;i&gt;tatrapudru&lt;/i&gt;, a local porridge, but turned out that Estonia is out of &lt;i&gt;tatar&lt;/i&gt;. The weather is cold, strong wind is blowing autumn colors off the trees. So been indoors working on our travel website. Will try to upload more photos and videos and complete some of the notes over the next few weeks.</description>

This time had a bed in the 13h overnight train. Slept for almost the whole duration of the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today scored our 40th UNESCO World Heritage site on this trip: the Summer Palace, an Imperial Garden in Beijing. (The full list of visited UNESCO sites is included in the &lt;a href="http://files.dropbox.com/u/1397729/trip2009/stat.html" target="_blank"&gt;trip statistics file&lt;/a&gt;.) The Summer Palace (entrance fee 60 CNY) is a pleasant set of parks, hills, bridges and temples by a surprisingly large Kunming lake 14km from the center of Beijing but easily reached by metro. (Both the metro and the Summer Palace were very crowded which seems to be usual for the Chinese mid-autumn holiday time.) Several halls in the palace complex contain museums showing Chinese bronze, glass, porcelain, jade etc. crafts, but most are simply shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow morning will fly to Helsinki and take a ferry from there to Tallinn. This will mark the end of our trip.</description>

We started at the railway station (North-eastern section of the wall) and walked 16.7km for 5h10min (moving time 4h09min) to complete the task a little before sunset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk takes place on the 15m-wide top of the wall, passing watch towers and going over city gates, and offers views to the moat and parks by the wall, and the city inside and outside the wall. Outside there are many skyscrapers and inside some older buildings. But nothing too spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a few entry points onto the wall are open to the public and one has to pay 40 CNY (= 6 USD) to enter. This might explain why there were relatively few people on the wall, especially in the Northern sections where the views are not so good. I wonder what the locals think about the situation that a relatively large area in the middle of the city is accessible only if you pay a considerable amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No food (beyond ice-cream) is sold on the wall so if you decide to go on this hike be sure to pack a sandwich. Also consider that your entry gate might have closed for the night when you arrive back to your starting point and that you have to break the law a bit and climb over some fences before you can sit down to your evening's dumplings and beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will do more sightseeing in Xi'an and in the evening will travel back to Beijing.</description>

Visited the downtown area that is quite modern and has no feel of an ancient city in spite of the 3000 years of history. Mostly there are modern buildings everywhere,&amp;nbsp; some have a local touch though with their pagoda shaped roofs. There is also a Muslim quarter that had a few interesting older houses and a few scripts in Arabic on the houses. Unfortunately this area does not convey much of a feel of the way of life a couple of centuries ago, as it is now full of tourist shops and restaurants. Many shops sell sweets and dried fruits, maybe that is supposed to give the area the Near East touch? At the end of this shopping street is a remnant of the old city: the Drum Tower. Its counterpart, the Bell Tower is only a few hundred meters away. Both date back to the 14th century and were used to mark dawn and night with the tolling of the bell and beating of the drum, respectively. The downtown is surrounded by the similarly old city wall that is really huge with its 12m height and 18m thickness. It is possible to walk around town on the top of the wall: it is our plan for today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we visited the famous Terracotta Warriors, who guard the tomb of the first Qin emperor. Although more than 2000 years old, it has only been discovered in 1976 when a bunch of locals were digging a well in this area and found some pieces of the warriors. The founder is now a famous person in China and works for the Museum on site. He also gives autographs to the visitors.&lt;br /&gt;The site is located about 1h bus-ride away from Xi'an. There are 3 major pits open to public and 2 more will be opened in a week. The biggest is pit 1 that contains supposedly about 6000 soldiers, all lined up facing east, except on the flanks, where one row of soldiers faces outwards. The warriors are standing in long corridors, separated by walls. They had to put them into this formation, because they were covered with a roof&amp;nbsp; (and also by soil, as it all was meant to be underground) and the logs used were only that long. Only about 2000 terracotta soldiers have been excavated and reconstructed here. The rest lay underground or lay in small pieces scattered on the ground. According to the historians, after the death of the emperor, there was an uprising and his tomb was looted and the terracotta soldiers were destroyed and burned. This makes the excavation and reconstruction very difficult as it is more like a puzzle game. Allegedly it requires half a year to put one single warrior together. So far they found only one archer in an almost complete shape. One problem is that the soldiers are painted in 13 different colors, but a few days after they are excavated they lose this color. Now the scientists try to work out a method to preserve the color and will go on with the further excavation when they have found a solution. In pit 1 there are also a few chariots, pulled by 4 horses each, but as the chariots were made of wood, they have disintegrated. &lt;br /&gt;The only pit that has been fully excavated is pit 3 with only 68 figures. It is supposed to be the headquarters of the army, containing many high ranking officers, a few guards and a wooden chariot. &lt;br /&gt;Pit 2 again contains many warriors, but from different divisions. Unlike in pit 1, there are also archers (both kneeling and standing) and cavaliers and not only infantry members. Interestingly, the cavaliers are not riding their horses, but only standing next to them. In the pits one can only view the soldiers from a viewing platform, meaning the closest figure is still about 10-15 meters away and below the surface. Coming close up to a few soldiers is only possible in pit 3, where there are a few glass cabinets. Here one realizes the most impressive thing about the site: the details of the figures. Their clothing, their hairstyle, their facial expressions including their wrinkles are all remarkably elaborately sculpted, even the pattern on the sole of their shoes... furthermore, all 6000-8000 soldiers look different... quite impressive.. and all that hassle for a dead emperor... &lt;br /&gt;An other surprising thing we learned was that already 2000 years ago they put a thin chromium cover on their bronze swords to protect them and keep them sharp. In the modern world this technology that we now commonly use on our knives was only reinvented in the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;I also have to comment on the technology used to make the 2m tall figures. The legs, that are solid, the body, that is hollow and the head that is also solid were made separately and the heads can still be separated. The horses are also hollow and have holes on the sides, probably to enhance the drying procedure. The tails can also be removed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An other remarkable thing that has to be mentioned here: after a few weeks in Chinese territory Kaarel knows already 45 Chinese characters. He mainly translates the city names and metro station names with the help of Google translator. So his knowledge covers mostly geographic names. He also bought an&amp;nbsp; interesting book that tracks back the history of a few hundred characters and shows how they originated and changed over time.</description>

At this point it seems that it will be our only site to visit outside of Beijing on this trip. It is famous for the Army of Terracotta Warriors, consisting of over 6000 larger than life size soldiers, that were buried with emperor Qin Shi Huang 2000 years ago, for a reason currently not well understood. There are also other sights in the city, including the city wall, a bell tower and a Muslim quarter with good food. These are on our current to see list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we visited the zoo in Beijing and saw the first giant pandas in their homeland. There were two buildings each with 4-5 pandas. As expected, they were not really active, most of them sleeping and the rest of them munching on bamboo or watermelon. It is quite funny to watch them eating like a king, laying on their backs, with their hind legs comfortably stretched out and slowly chewing their food that they hold on their fat belly. In the panda houses there were quite informative posters about the pandas and their conservation and their relation with the Olympic Games in 2008. But it was almost the only place in the whole zoo, where some more detailed information was available. In the rest of the zoo, only the names of the animals were written in English, everything else was in Chinese. The housing conditions of the larger animals was not that outrageous. As probably any zoo that is confined to the middle of a large city, this zoo must also be struggling with space problems. For example, they have only a few outdoor enclosures for the large cats, so half of them had to stay indoors in cages which are definitely way too small for them. They have the well known and sad heritage of other zoos as well: the menagerie kind of housing. So I guess it will take quite some time and money to get rid of it and convert the zoo into a nice spacious habitat for the animals. What I missed though in many places were the environmental enrichment practices, including toys to prevent boredom of the animals. A very annoying thing was the behaviour of the local visitors. They were knocking loudly on every window or shouting, to wake up the sleeping animals or to make them look into their cameras. Feeding of the animals is also a common practise, in spite of the large forbidding sings. An interesting feature of the Beijing zoo is the arbitrary mixing of different species in the same enclosure, e.g. chicken  or squirrel monkey from South America with the ring-tailed lemur from Madagascar. Chicken we also saw in the cages of other animals and it made us think where the fried chicken in the food stalls next to these cages might originate from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before yesterday we spent in the southern part of downtown Beijing. Our original goal was to visit the Underground City that is a long tunnel system, dug out in the 70s in the fear of a nuclear attack surprise, surprise from the Soviets! It was dug out by hand by over 300'000 citizens. In the case of an attack it could have housed 40% of the city's population and had room for hospitals, schools, mushroom cultivation facilities (that can grow without sunlight), bathrooms, cinemas etc. However, it seems to be impossible to visit these tunnels as a tourist. On different websites 3 different addresses are listed as potential entrances, but they are either closed permanently (永久, as we found out at 62 Xidamo Changjie, Qianmen) or have a different function now (theatre, camera shop). So instead of the underground tunnels, we visited the close-by Temple of Heaven. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Why exactly is not really clear to me, as we did not find it all that interesting. It is located in the middle of a well-kept large park (it actually does not have much useful space for locals to do activities as there are only few benches and open spaces). The temple itself is a round wooden building with similar decoration as the palaces in the Forbidden City. It is connected with an elevated walkway to another temple and to the Round Altar. The latter one is a 3 level marble construction that symbolises heaven. The purpose of these buildings was for the emperor to pray for good harvest and offer animal sacrifices in an elaborately composed ritual. The most interesting thing here was perhaps to watch the locals picking walnuts from the trees in the park.</description>

It is quite cold, at some point had to wear my jacket and fleece, something that I haven't done since Papua New Guinea Highlands (in May).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today&lt;/b&gt; visited the Great Wall of China. Lonely Planet lists 7 places around Beijing where one can see the wall. Our hostel's receptionist recommended Juyongguan as it is less touristy and closest to the city. Bus number 919 from the Deshengmen station takes you there but locating this bus turned out to be too complex for us: the station seemed to have no central information/ticket office, and is more like set of bus stops scattered over a larger area. Most of the buses are called 919, I guess their subtypes can be distinguished by a few Chinese characters next to the number. Nobody speaks English. Gave up and took a bus to Badaling (70km NW from the city), the most popular site to view the Wall, also serviced by bus 919.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, Badaling was very touristy, with a very well restored segment of the wall, surrounded by restaurants, amusement parks, souvenir vendors, and a cable car line. Even a bunch of sad looking Asian bears are kept in a pit for entertainment. Locals feed them carrots. The Wall is very steep in some parts and was very slippery due to the rain. Good that they have installed hand rails. Walked a couple of kilometers along two stretches of the wall, some more remote parts were almost empty so one could take pictures with no people on them, although visibility to the wall snaking away over the hills was quite bad. The more touristy parts were crowded with Chinese tourist groups who were all interested in taking photos with us. So some time was spent on that but we are used to this by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bus back to Beijing got stuck in a rush hour traffic jam and took about 2h longer than the trip out of town in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yesterday&lt;/b&gt; visited the Forbidden City, another must-see Beijing sight. It's a large territory covered with orderly laid out Chinese houses and crowded with tourist groups. The most interesting thing for me was the location-aware audio guide that one can rent and the fact that they offer these guides in 40 different languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/b&gt; will try to buy the train ticket for an overnight journey to Xi'an to see the Terracotta Army there. But it seems that these tickets sell out quickly, so might have to postpone the trip by a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It's been now more than 400 days on the road for us. Thinking of going home soon.)</description>

It's already 13 o'clock today so it's getting late for the Forbidden City visit. Will probably just visit the Lama temple today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday visited the National Aquatic Center, also known as Water Cube, where in 2008 the Olympic swimming events took place. Our goal was to swim in the same pool where the Hungarian waterpolo team claimed the Olympic gold. The building has been reopened to the public this July after being under renovation for 10 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visiting the Cube costs 15 CNY, but for 50 CNY you can add swimming to your visit. When purchasing the swimming ticket you learn that the pool is open from 13 to 21. While making your way towards to pool you learn about more regulations and hidden costs. First, you cannot swim in the main pool (where the Olympic competitions took place), but only in the warm-up pool. Then you are required to purchase a swimming cap (34 CNY), without it swimming is not allowed. Finally you are given a choice: either swim in shallow water (0.8-1.2m) or pay an additional 20 CNY to apply for the "deep-water swimmer's certificate" (includes medical examination). We decided to buy one cap (has a Water Cube logo on it, so it can be considered a nice souvenir rather than a hidden cost) and share it while swimming (and walking) in the shallow water. The pool was almost empty. Later it turned out that Biros and co never played in the Water Cube: the water polo events took place in another building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent the rest of the visit sitting by the main pool watching the dancers of Moscow City Ballet practice for their evening performance. That must explain why the banks of the main pool are decorated with fake bushes and garden swans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Water Cube building is nothing spectacular inside. Probably was designed to be looked at from the outside, and during the night and from the air. Then it is glowing (in blue) impressively next to the National Stadium (popularly known as The Bird's Nest), which is glowing red and gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The square between the main Olympic buildings is huge, much larger than Tian'anmen Square (which our guidebook claims to be the largest in the world).&lt;br /&gt;Around sunset the square got crowded with kite flying people, unfortunately the kind who want to sell their kite to the tourist. The vendors here are very persistent and they only know numbers in English. Learned the Chinese word for "no" (bù yòng ?) and got to practice it a lot.</description>

An HI Hostel that we were looking for wasn't there so we ended up in a local business hotel. We were completely unprepared in terms of hotel bookings, maps, GPS coordinates, basic knowledge of local language, etc. This morning changed the hotel for a youth hostel (which is also a bit cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beijing is BIG. We have a map with no sale marked onto it, so it's hard to estimate how big it actually is, but walking doesn't get you anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a major language barrier: we only know "ni hao" (hello) and "xie xie" (thank you), that's how far I got when I was learning Mandarin a year ago, and locals know "sorry" and "no" in English. It is possible to order food in McDonald's and get basic directions in the metro though. The local people are quite helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The metro costs only 2 CNY (= 0.3 USD) for any distance (?) and functions well. Only yesterday Line 2 was partly down (or closed for the night?) and we had to travel part of the distance by taxi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The taxi driver didn't speak a word of English (in many other countries they are usually the only ones that do) and needed some pushing to return 10 CNY change from the 40 CNY that he was given.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The climate is hot but much more pleasant than Hong Kong, or the rest of Southeast and South Asia where we have been travelling until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internet is partly blocked, e.g. we haven't been able to access Dropbox (that hosts our website), Blogger (our blog), Picasaweb (our photos), YouTube (our videos), and Facebook. GMail works though and this blog post is made via email which should function I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It was quite interesting that these two parts of China are treated as separate countries. Unlike to China, here we could enter without&amp;nbsp; visa, but had to go through immigrations and customs at both ports. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As anticipated, Macau is very different from Hong Kong. There are a few skyscrapers concentrated mainly at the seaside, but it is by far not such an urban jungle as Hong Kong. Interestingly, after 10 years that the Portuguese gave back their colony to China (funny enough that the Portuguese tried to give back this tiny land already in the 70s, but China did not want it), still everywhere the signs, street names are in Portuguese. According to some schoolgirls we talked to, only very few people actually speak Portuguese. Probably removing these signs would cost too much... English is not widely spoken here and in most of the restaurants the menus are only in Chinese, so dining is quite difficult (of course at fancy places there are English menus, but these are over our budget). We probably will not try the famous Portuguese-Chinese fusion cuisine, because these dishes seem to be also expensive and I doubt that there is anything for vegetarians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we walked around in the area west from the Hotel Lisboa (the landmark building that our guidebook uses as a point of orientation). It is kind of like in Europe, the buildings are very European (protected by UNESCO, listed as a World Heritage Site since 2005), they are in a very good condition. The streets here were very clean and there were many tourists, but almost exclusively Chinese and no Westerners. This distribution of tourists might of course explain the lack of&amp;nbsp; English signs and language skill of the locals. The downtown area was very touristy. The main souvenir hit seems to be dried meet, that is pressed into big sheets and that is cut by scissors to the desired size. In that area we visited the remains of the catholic Sao Paolo church (burned down in 1835, so only the facade remains) that curiously is decorated with Jesus, Mary, some saints and Chinese lions and hydras with 7 heads. Next to it, on the top of a hill is a fort that is in a very good condition houses the Museum of Macau and offers nice views to the city. Unfortunately the view to the sea is blocked by the tall buildings (mostly hotels with casinos), so it could not fulfil it is original duty to watch over any danger emerging from the sea, meaning the Dutch. &lt;br /&gt;Today we will walk around in town a bit more and try to visit some casinos (if they let is in in our run down outfit: washing cannot effectively remove any more the stains of a year of travelling).</description>

Until yesterday waited for the Chinese visa but Hong Kong is enjoyable and there is a lot to see for one week anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2010-09-02&lt;/span&gt; Visited the China Resources Building and stood in line for an hour to hand in the Chinese visa application. Then visited the ifc mall, enjoyed the cool conditioned air and multiple antiseptic hand sanitizing stations. Adjusted the ferry trip back to Kowloon to coincide with the 8-o'clock light show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2010-09-03&lt;/span&gt; Visited the Science Museum. Quite informative and fun. Started out late so managed to fully explore only the bottom floor. Had dinner at a mock meat restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2010-09-04&lt;/span&gt; Completed the visit to the Science Museum (we had purchased a 7-day multiple-museum pass the day before). Then visited the Temple St. Night Market. Considered buying a Chinese iPhone 4 knock-off for 2900 HKD (eventually the price went down to 1000 HKD, i.e. 10x lower than for the original iPhone 4). Didn't buy&lt;br /&gt;because wasn't convinced by the seller's claim that the clone is 99% identical to the original. (Later turned out that at Chungking Mansions the Indians sell them for 450 HKD.) Watched tai-chi at the Kowloon Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2010-09-05&lt;/span&gt; Visited The Peak for some fascinating night time views to the Hong Kong Island. Moving around on the Hong Kong Island as a pedestrian is a remarkably pleasant experience as one hardly has to interact with car traffic.&lt;br /&gt;For example, it is possible to reach The Peak from the Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui without crossing a single street: first enter the metro at Tsim Sha Tsui and walk underground to the Space Museum and from there to the Star Ferry pier. Then take a ferry over to the Hong Kong Island's Pier 7. Then walk on the elevated pedestrian walkway from Pier 7 to the lower escalator station, and take the set of escalators (longest escalator system in the world!) to as high up the hill as possible. Walk downhill on the sidewalks and pedestrian streets to the Zoological and Botanical Gardens (free entry). From there walk downhill to the lower cable car station, and take it to The Peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TIcgItd1bKI/AAAAAAAAER8/I0HbDNybUdk/s1600/P1350603.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="300" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5514411602754235554" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TIcgItd1bKI/AAAAAAAAER8/I0HbDNybUdk/s400/P1350603.JPG" style="display: block; height: 240px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2010-09-06&lt;/span&gt; Visited Disneyland. It's far away from the centre but easily accessible thanks to the Hong Kong metro system. Hong Kong's Disneyland is very similar to the one in Orlando that I visited in 2006 (maybe that's the point), i.e. apart from the few rides it is mostly about shopping and fast food restaurants. Did almost all the rides, the best is "It's a small world" that takes you through all the main regions of the world (North Pole, Europe, Africa, Asia, Americas, Rainforest, Islands) represented by a set of characteristically dressed up dancing puppets who continuously sing the same song "It's a small world after all" (in different languages).&lt;br /&gt;Also took photos with all the animals who were around (Pooh, Goofy, Mickey, Minnie, Pluto), Donald wasn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TIchwJAPwOI/AAAAAAAAESE/65gIMrtMsc4/s1600/P1350764.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="400" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5514413379672850658" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TIchwJAPwOI/AAAAAAAAESE/65gIMrtMsc4/s400/P1350764.JPG" style="display: block; height: 320px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 240px;" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Yesterday&lt;/span&gt; collected the Chinese visa (150 HKD for single entry with regular application processing speed). Then visited the 55th floor of the ifc II building. There are 88 floors in total but only the 55th is open to tourists (given that you present your photo ID) because it hosts a museum and a small library of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. More incredible views to the vertical city of Hong Kong. Finally visited some markets at the Mong Kok district (electronic goods, goldfish and other pets, e.g. puppies and kittens in tiny cages, flowers, birds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Today&lt;/span&gt; will try to visit some beaches on the Southern side of the Hong Kong Island and later in the evening some museums. Tomorrow will go to Macau (world largest casinos and a UNESCO World Heritage downtown).</description>

It is good to be in a clean, quiet and civilized environment, e.g. where you can walk on the sidewalks without worrying about stepping into cow shit, stumbling over a sleeping person, being bitten by a rabid dog, being spat on, and run over by a auto-rickshaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our new home is in the Chungking Mansion (Tsim Sha Tsui district), a labyrinth-like 20-storey building full of guest houses, all scattered over the whole building, e.g. our tiny room (including a 1m2 bathroom containing shower, sink and toilet) is on the 6th floor C-block while the guest house reception is on the 11th floor B-block. Interestingly, the building is full on Indians (and their food and music) and Africans. So we haven't been quite able to leave India just yet. But this place seems to be one of the few that offers reasonably priced accommodation (180 H$ = 23 USD) in Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday evening promenaded the southern tip of the Kowloon peninsula (the Avenue of Stars) and watched the laser show --- the skyscrapers of the Hong&amp;nbsp; Kong island lighting up by the rhythm of the music and a few green laser beams shot into the sky. The view to the Hong Kong island with the lit up sky scrapers is impressive even without the laser show. The show could have actually been better (maybe the foggy weather made it worse), plus the background music sucked and the sea stank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TH8oeOHHapI/AAAAAAAAERs/Jh2Vrl0Sh-4/s1600/P1350186-747710.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="300" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5512168968573905554" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TH8oeOHHapI/AAAAAAAAERs/Jh2Vrl0Sh-4/s400/P1350186-747710.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished the evening at an Irish pub eating sausages with beans and mashed potatoes, and drinking beer. (To appreciate the significance of this consider that all of this stuff was illegal in Gujarat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TH8oddkOClI/AAAAAAAAERk/6GjFifDaVzs/s1600/P1350204-745478.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="300" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5512168955542637138" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TH8oddkOClI/AAAAAAAAERk/6GjFifDaVzs/s400/P1350204-745478.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;TODO-list for Hong Kong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;apply for the Chinese visa (will take at least 3 days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit several museums: Art, Space, Science, Zoo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit Disneyland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;consider buying a new camera (the flashing and focusing capability of our 5-year-old Lumix has been deteriorating over the recent months)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit the 55th floor the IFC Mall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit Macau&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit several markets: goldfish, flower, bird, night food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;climb to The Peak and/or to The Great Buddha to enjoy the views to the city&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit the Kowloon Park and swim in its Olympic-sized swimming pool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

We are both fit now and ready to go on. Considering the natural catastrophes unfolding and the different epidemics, we decided to go to Hong Kong. We will visit India during an other trip. Our flight is on the 1st of September. We will  probably spend a week in Hong Kong with a side trip to Macau and then fly to Beijing.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we did our first sightseeing here, visited the house where Gandiji spent 15 years of his life.</description>

At first glance this town looks like a big pile of garbage with traffic more horrible than in Vietnam. But there are some interesting places around here that we are planning to visit, e.g. the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarmati_Ashram" title="Ashram"&gt;Sabarmati Ashram&lt;/a&gt; and some step wells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far been hanging out at the hotel room because I feel a bit sick: must have caught cold in the rainy Mumbai (and hopefully not malaria the epidemic of which just broke out there). The hotels here are quite clean (considering the garbage that surrounds them) and most of them seem to have cable TV but unfortunately no wifi. (In general, the availability of internet in India seems to be even worse than in Africa (although the internet is much faster here) + one has to submit his full passport details when going online in a cyber cafe.)</description>

Could sleep for about 1 hour in the plane (watched Iron Man 2 for the rest of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taxi took us to the center, the Fort district, about 1h away from the airport (~10 USD). Our initial pick for a hotel (YWCA) proved to be way too expensive: ~60 USD per night (Lonely Planet India 2009 listed the price as 30 USD) + they wanted to charge us for one extra night because we had arrived before the offical check-in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we decided to look for something else. Navigating through the streets full of sleeping people and stray dogs and visiting several guesthouses which were all full (or this is what the sleepy guesthouse managers claimed) we finally ended up at a place which was just 600 rupees (13 USD). The room is very basic (bed + fan + toilet) and a bit dirty. Accommodation-wise it's surely different here (at least in Mumbai) from Southeast Asia where 13 USD can often get you a room with shower, wifi, and cable TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today have been mostly sleeping. Tomorrow will check out some of the local tourist attractions: a beach, the Bollywood movie industry, a couple of UNESCO World Heritage sights, and some temples. Haven't decided yet if we move to South, East or North after Mumbai.</description>

Early tomorrow morning will be in India already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today&lt;/b&gt; learned to meditate at the &lt;a href="http://www.meditation-watmahadhat.com/English-Language.html"&gt;Meditation Study and Retreat Center at Wat Mahadhat&lt;/a&gt;. In the first lesson practised walking slowly and sitting up straight and focusing on tiny annoyances e.g. itching. Didn't reach Nibbana yet. Will keep trying, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yesterday&lt;/b&gt; posted 8kg of stuff to Europe (1762 THB = 55 USD, incl. the parcel and wrapping). The stuff that is scheduled to reach its destination in 2-3 months (as it goes overland) includes: 2 books, a pile of paper, 2 foot badminton shuttlecocks, K's old notebook, shells, seeds, 10 cheap pearls, 4 fridge magnets, 4 T-shirts, K's old broken shirt, a Vietnamese mother-of-pearl box, a PNG string bag, a Batak calendar, 2 paper lamps, 2 cute owl-shaped backpacks, 2 packs of tea, a toy elephant, a kangaroo-shaped pen, a hammock, a painting depicting Lao monks, a box of coconut candy, South-east Asian coins and paper notes, a toy dragon fly.&lt;br /&gt;Getting rid of 8kg of stuff was liberating but we didn't stop there: taking advantage of Banglamphu's healthy used bookstore scene we managed to sell 8 of our books that have been piling up over the months (must have been at least 5kg). It was good to have some income (16 USD), something that we have not experienced during more than a year now. For more details about these books see &lt;a href="http://files.dropbox.com/u/1397729/trip2009/asia/stories/books.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two days ago&lt;/b&gt; visited the Golden Mountain which offered some overview of the city. Then met Sumpun for a few beers, and finally went to see the fireworks at Sanam Luang in honour of the Queen who celebrated her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many things that we failed to see in Bangkok (considering that we stayed here so long in total), e.g. the Anantasamakhom Throne Hall, the Bowl village, Royal Barges Museum, Dusit Zoo, National Theatre, and of course the Big Standing Buddha that every tuk-tuk driver (or his English-speaking pimp) that we have talked to (or, rather, who has talked to us) has recommended us (or, rather, urged us immediately) to see. We have always thought it to be some sort of scam and thus postponed our visit. So, maybe next time...</description>

Staying again at the Happy House Guesthouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last 6 nights we spent in Siem Reap focusing on the nearby Angkor temples. During 3 days we visited some 25 temples. There are many more but these are further away and/or are less preserved. Highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the well-preserved bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat (unfortunately the "Churning of the Sea of Milk" was under renovation and thus not accessible)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the structurally complex Bayon temple + its bas-reliefs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the elaborately carved lintels and pediments of Banteay Srei&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the thousands of &lt;i&gt;lingas&lt;/i&gt; carved into the riverbed (along with several copies of the "Reclining Vishnu") at Kbal Spean&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Regarding the interplay between nature and culture, it was not so good. We missed all the famous sunsets and sunrises over the Angkor temples as it was always cloudy (which is usual for the rainy season).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will spend a few days now in Bangkok before flying to Mumbai. The Queen has her birthday tomorrow, probably will try to take part of it in some form. Otherwise the TODO-list includes "doing laundry", "posting extra kilos to Europe", "extending our travel insurance", etc.</description>

Our guesthouse manager in Kratie claimed that it is impossible to visit the dolphins and travel to Siem Reap all in one day but his advice was probably driven by his short term business interests (to have us stay in his guesthouse for one extra day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way to Siem Reap changed buses in the town of Skuon, famous for its &lt;a href="http://www.camboguide.com/food-and-culinary/spiders.html"&gt;deep-fried spiders&lt;/a&gt;. We didn't know if we have to spend the night in Skuon or is there still a connection to Siem Reap. In the end it appeared so quickly that we had no time to check out the spiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday morning visited the Irrawaddy Dolphins (&lt;i&gt;Orcaella brevirostris&lt;/i&gt;). The segment of river where they hang out is 15km upriver from Kratie. Tuktuk there and back costs 7 USD. From the riverbank you can arrange a 1.5h boat ride for 9 USD per person. Everything is well organized, e.g. the money is paid to a central ticket office. We had many sightings but it remained unclear how may instances we saw as there is no &lt;a href="http://www.projetoboto.com/"&gt;Projeto Boto&lt;/a&gt; here to mark the dolphins. The animals didn't come that much out of the water either, revealing only their dorsal fins and blow-holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TFt9qKfOAtI/AAAAAAAAEPI/IhkAuP2-j4A/s1600/P1330722.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5502129533086466770" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TFt9qKfOAtI/AAAAAAAAEPI/IhkAuP2-j4A/s320/P1330722.JPG" style="display: block; height: 240px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" title="Irrawaddy Dolphin emerging from Mekong" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Irrawaddy dolphin swimming in Mekong at Kampi, Cambodia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Future plans include spending 3 days at the Angkor Archaeological Park and then going back to Thailand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our netbook started working again so we didn't suffer any loss of data. (Otherwise would have lost one week worth of photos that had not been copied to our external harddrive yet.)</description>

Some children collect empty (or half-empty) cans of soft drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our today's donations/purchases:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;purchased 10 small doughnuts: 8000 KHR (~ 2 USD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;donated 3 small doughnuts to three begging children&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;donated a half-empty can of Coke to a can-collecting boy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;donated 2 small doughnuts to a one-legged man&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;accepted one flyer that promised 0.25 USD beer at a disco party in the evening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;donated 1 USD to a blind singer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The beach is quite littered. Here at the beach bar/restaurant area it is not so bad but further along the coast to the yet to be developed area where locals go to have picnics it is very dirty, mostly with picnic food boxes. There are numerous small streams flowing into the sea. Csilla is convinced that these carry the crap of Sihanoukville into the water and has thus decided not to swim here at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday visited the Beach Road hotel that is run by a group of Estonians. The room prices there start at 15 USD (we are staying here at 5 USD) so we didn't venture beyond the restaurant area. Some Estonian attributes were present: an Estonian flag hanging outside; a clock showing Tallinn-time; a bookshelf with books by Mati Unt, Mihkel Raud and Jaroslav Hašek, among others; and an Estonian couple in a corner table working on their laptop (we briefly interacted with them). The menu included some potato-dishes (ate a good "fried potatoes with egg and cheese") but no real Estonian specialities (what are these anyway?). The drink list included Segu Seitse (red wine with Coke) but not the highlights Vana Tallinn and Viru Valge.</description>

Spend most of the day today in a Mekong slowboat, sleeping, and later waving to naked Cambodian children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will probably see the sights of  Phnom Penh and decide what to do next. Csilla wants to see dolphins in Kratie and the Estonian hotel owners in Sihanoukville. I just want to see Angkor Wat and then go back to Bangkok. But Cambodia seems nice, nobody is honking here, maybe it's worth staying here longer.</description>

The whole visit felt like being on a conveyor belt: there were many other tour groups around and the focus was on buying stuff. In the evening ended up in the town of Can Tho where we are now staying overnight to continue this 3-day tour tomorrow morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was saved by a delicious (but unfortunately small) portion of Zürcher Geschnetzeltes mit Rösti in restaurant Pizza.CT (if I&amp;#39;m interpreting their business card correctly). The rösti was real, not some local interpretation like on the Galapagos and Java.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to tomorrow. The Mekong Delta is famous for its rice, farmers get 3 harvests per year. Was a bit disappointed today that we were presented with honey instead.</description>

There is a nice sandy stretch of beach just a few meters from our hotel, however the waves are quite big and thus swimming or snorkelling is not really possible. Kaarel had a lot of fun jumping into the waves. Quite a weird thing was that some hotels let their used water run directly into the sea and although it stinks, some people were bathing right there in the outflow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Kaarel had to work and was feeling a bit sick (must be the strong air-conditioning in the hotels), so we stayed mostly at the hotel. This morning we planned to walk a few kilometres to the Fairy Spring: a creek running in a small canyon with nice rock formations and sand dunes, but it stared raining last night and has not stopped yet. The other main attraction here are the white and red sand dunes with a water lily pond somewhere in the middle. Must be quite nice, so next time we will visit it.&lt;br /&gt;At noon we take a bus to Saigon and after a few days we have to leave Vietnam, as our visa is expiring soon. Looking forward to seeing Estonians in Cambodia (they are running a hotel in the south, at a beach), the first ones during a year of travelling!!! Could somebody please convince Kaarel that it could be fun to meet fellow countrymen?</description>

Temperature is pleasant here: no need to choose between an hotel room with fan or with AC as neither is needed here. Lonely Planet raves about "elegant French-colonial villas" but during a brief visit to the town centre we failed to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent yesterday evening in Nha Trang visiting the museum of Yersin and a complex of Cham temples, most of them dedicated to Shiva. This morning woke up at 5am and hung out with the rest of the Nha Trang people on the beach. Surprisingly the beach is most crowded early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will try to visit the Hang Nga Crazy House and a silk farm.</description>

The old buildings which have somehow survived the several wars give the town a special atmosphere. These days the houses are tourist-oriented, hosting souvenirs, restaurants, and tailor shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday morning (now) it is quite pleasant, otherwise quite crowded with tourists and locals. The latter group contributes considerably to the noise pollution and other spam: constant honking and "buy from me", " everything one dollar". I misread the Lonely Planet, that motorbikes are banned from the centre of town. The reality is that "this town is for walkers and for primitive vehicle users" (as the signs declare at the entry points to the center) and that the numerous motorbikers are clearly among these primitive users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TEPmX0NG4aI/AAAAAAAAENU/7QBq4xZ7wCg/s1600/P1320322.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5495489267147137442" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/TEPmX0NG4aI/AAAAAAAAENU/7QBq4xZ7wCg/s320/P1320322.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" title="Sunset on the beach. Many locals have come to eat and swim." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to escape the noise is to bike to the Cua Dai beach (6 km away). The ride there is rough (spoiled by honking), but once there, it is quite relaxing. There are many simple restaurants that can keep an eye on your bikes, provide you with a deck chair and a beach umbrella, as long as you order something (the prices are somewhat higher than in town). Around sunset local women start to show up and set up their mobile food stalls, right at the waterfront, and start grilling meat over charcoal. Then the local customers also start  streaming in and soon the beach gets quite crowded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning as early as 5 am we took a tour to My Son, an other UNESCO World Heritage site, only an hour drive away, where the Hindu temples of the ancient Cham civilization stand. Or whatever remained after the heavy bombardment of the US forces. The site was indeed quite destroyed, but still quite impressive, considering that the oldest ones were built when the Hungarians were still riding around somewhere in the "Puszta".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This afternoon we will take an overnight bus to Nha Trang. Officially 12 hours, but based on our Hanoi-Hue bus experience, probably 3h longer.</description>

Hue is much quieter than Hanoi although also here the driving culture includes constant purposeless honking. Food and beer is more than two times cheaper but restaurants unfortunately close already at 10pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday it was raining all day cooling down the air (which is otherwise around 40 degrees). We rented bikes for 1 USD each per day (motorbikes are also cheap at 3 USD per day) and drove out of the city to the south to visit the royal tombs. In the end we only managed to visit the Tu Duc tomb; the tomb of Dong Khanh was under restoration and closed to the visitors, the tomb of Thieu Tri was only partly accessible (it has not been restored at all), and the other tombs remained too far away (we started our bike trip only in the afternoon). The tombs are close to the Perfume River, the river bank offering a nice view to the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today will take a 3.5h bus to Hoi An. Looking forward to this nice town which has banned all motorbikes from its center.</description>

People are impolite, not very friendly and even rude sometimes (also with their fellow countrymen). The food we had so far was nothing special, in a small village even disgusting and caused diarrhea. Even in Hanoi we did not feel like trying street food, because it did not smell and look good. So it only leaves the expensive restaurants or the tourist restaurants, which are expensive and food id not good (had the worse fried rice here in SA Asia so far). Kaarel is missing his 7-eleven hot dogs from Thailand as they were cheap and good and gave a nice variety to the rice and noodle diet.&lt;br /&gt;In Hanoi the streets are very crowded, there are millions of motorbikes and the drives have no manners, cross the red light, turn everywhere in every possible angle and only use their honks to drive. The prices are much higher than in Laos, but the service is worse. The only interesting thing so far was the water puppet theatre, although the movements and the puppets themselves are not that sophisticated as they were in Thailand. Visited the Temple of Literature, which was not really impressive, neither was the Ho Chi Mihn Museum (did not learn much about uncle Ho, as the displays seemed to be chaotic without temporal order, no information about his ideas and visions or his achievements, only many photographs of him). The old quarter was quite ok, there were some interesting shops: Buddhist shops, herbal medicine shops selling dried sea horse and pangolin (of course illegal) and weight reduction coffee, advertised with leptin on the label (no clue though how the adipocyte hormone would get into the coffee????). We also saw the weasel coffee sold here, although we thought it was a Javan specialty and produced by civet (the idea is that the civet eats the coffee beans and what comes out on the other end is collected -hopefully disinfected- and sold very expensive. The digestion process is supposed to give a special flavor to the coffee and is said to be the best coffee in the world and also the most expensive. En guete!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after that we are looking forward to leave Hanoi tomorrow. We booked a 3 days trip to Halong Bay. We are just wondering what the hook will be in that trip... Somehow we both have the gut feeling that it will not be perfect, but we let the tour operator surprise us...</description>

First impressions of Vietnam quite negative: food disgusting; music loud, boring, and unavoidable; people not keeping their promises (the bus to Hanoi dumped us 10km from the center even though we had agreed on the center before); hostels were all booked out, the few remaining ones very expensive by Asian standards; lots of drunken foreign teenagers. I'm sure today will be better.</description>

The last 4 nights we spent in Luang Prabang (Louang Phabang), a very touristy UNESCO World Heritage site,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;visiting temples;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;swimming in the Kuang Si waterfalls (1h tuktuk drive from the town); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;climbing the sacred Phou Si hill in the center of the town;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;buying souvenirs, fruit shakes and French baguettes at the night market;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;speaking English with local schoolboys (a &lt;a href="http://www.bigbrothermouse.com/"&gt;Big Brother Mouse&lt;/a&gt; initiative);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visiting the Royal Palace (now National Museum), with the most famous Lao Buddha statue in a side chapel and in the courtyard a Soviet-made statue of the last king of Laos handing over the country to the communists (in 1975);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;observing the local alms ritual at 5-6am (involving long lines of teenage monks, old ladies and men giving each of them small portions of sticky rice, another set of old ladies selling such portions to tourists so that they can make the offering, and a bunch of tourists photographing everything).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In general, after 9 days in Laos, it seems quite similar to Thailand: same style temples, same religion (Buddhism and animism), people watching Thai TV (where Thai anthem is played every evening at 6), same food, shops sell Thai snacks (which are two times more expensive than in a Thai 7-eleven), one can pay in Thai Baht, etc. Looking forward to Vietnam which is likely to be different.</description>

Should reach Chiang Khong in 5h and cross the border to Laos from there, maybe today, maybe tomorrow morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week in Chiang Mai has been full of activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Sunday street market. Lots of different handicraft were sold but we didn't buy anything. I need to buy new flip-flops but the ones sold are too expensive and/or too small. One notable item was small cages of birds that one could buy to release (just 20 Baht). Is releasing a bird a good thing (because a bird would be released), or a bad thing because it encourages capture of birds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited several second-hand bookstores. Most of the books are in English (but there are also shelves dedicated to Finnish) and the selection is quite good. The books could be cheaper though, e.g. paid 280 Baht for a book about Ramanujan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ate several 7-eleven hot-dogs, but also ate at night food markets, a university mensa, and a fancier restaurant that offers northern Thai food (e.g. rice with pickled pork)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited a Thai boxing match. Our favourite Petsiam unfortunately lost against the Japanese Tsubasa. Did not gamble as it was said to be illegal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the "Flight of the Gibbon" i.e. riding a set of zip-lines through the jungle. Could have been more extreme...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did a 3-days/2-nights trekking in the hills north of Chiang Mai. Saw some orchids and butterflies; hiked though some rice and fruit plantations; hiked in a jungle; washed and then rode some elephants; next morning hiked some more to the altitude of 1060m where the temperature is cooler (pine trees start to grow there) and where the Lahu people had set up a village (didn't learn much about the Lahu people besides that they want to massage you for 150 Baht + tip); then played some Celebrity Heads with out fellow trekkers; next morning hiked down the slippery hillside; swam in a natural pool below a waterfall; did some grade 1 white-water rafting; then some bamboo rafting (the raft was almost entirely submerged as there was 7 of us on it); and then went back to Chiang Mai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Immigration Office to find out if we need a re-entry permit since we want to come back to Thailand in a month or so to catch a flight from Bangkok. We were told that we don't need a re-entry permit as citizens of both Hungary and Estonia can get a new visa at the Cambodian border (free of charge). Remains to be seen if it really works this way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited Doi Suithep up in the hills (1050m and nice cool temperature again). This temple hosts some relics of Buddha. Didn't see them. Are they stored in the golden pagoda?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Chiang Mai zoo (100 Baht + 100 Baht extra is you want to see the pandas). Panda seems to be the symbol of Chiang Mai even though in Thailand no pandas live and the ones at the Zoo are a gift from China. The highlight of the Zoo are 3 hippos whose enclosure is so close to the walking path that one could touch them if one wanted. (Note that hippo is a pretty dangerous animal, being the 2nd most frequent killer of tourists in Africa.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

This was the longest time we had spent in one place. Two more fewer pages left blank in the passports. But at least we may now enter Vietnam and India with our shiny new visas. During that time we completed most of the things on our to do list for Bangkok. I had to admit that I quite enjoyed reading and relaxing in the air conditioned hotel room for a change. Although for Kaarel it was not that relaxing, since he also had some work to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight was meeting my friend Sumpun. It was great to catch up with him and spend some time together around his home place. We visited the floating markets with him that is located an hour drive away from Bangkok. The small town has many channels that were built for the irrigation of the fruit tree plantations and now are used by the locals as a mean of transportation. It was quite interesting with the many boats, although very touristy with many souvenir stalls instead of local products. At one place we even fed some fish in a canal. There were tons of them fighting over the food, but still that did not distract them enough to make it easy to catch them. Even though the water was literally boiling with fish, they still escaped our hands very fast. Quite disappointing for Kaarel...&lt;br /&gt;We also visited Phutthamonthon where there is a huge Buddha statue (with 15.87 m it is he highest free-standing Buddha statue of the world) in the middle of a beautifully kept large park. There were many very very old bonsai trees (I was very impressed and jealous when I saw these masterpieces!!) and bushes pruned in the shape of different animals, e.g. elephants, deers, horses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Bangkok we visited some more Buddhist temples, a few IT malls, where interestingly small boutique-like private shops are clustered, offering more or less the same things for differing prices including a lot of pirated DVDs and software. We also managed to get up early and give alms to a monk who passed by around our hotel. It was a nice gesture, although I am not quite convinced that all the monks are respectable beings, as is the case with the priests. We saw many monks in shopping malls enjoying fruit shakes, buying sweets and one we caught even smoking. Hanging on their cellphones seemed just to be a very normal thing... We skipped the Thai boxing match in Bangkok, because it was quite expensive and the Segway tour for the same reason. Other than Kaarel teasing the tuk-tuk drives, we avoided interaction with them, so we walked quite a lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we had a very long busride to Chiang Mai, located in Northern Thailand. It took a little bit longer than the planned 12h, because the bus was driving 40 km/h at the beginning and broke down eventually. So we had to wait for hours for an other vehicle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What shall we do next? Possible activities in and around Chiang Mai include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight of the Gibbon:&amp;nbsp; flying fox zip lines and hanging bridges in the jungle canopy (&lt;a href="http://www.treetopasia.com/"&gt;www.treetopasia.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;elephant rides in the jungle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;trekking and visiting the hilltribes, including the Kayan where the women twist copper wires around their necks to make it grow longer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thai boxing match (Petsiam, presumingly the Thai champion vs. Tsubasa, a Japanese fighter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pet tigers at the Tiger Kingdom (&lt;a href="http://www.tigerkingdom.com/Home.htm"&gt;www.tigerkingdom.com/Home.htm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit Immigration Office for a re-entry permit to Thailand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit Sunday market or night bazaar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;visit more Buddhist temples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

The border crossing took an hour since the King of Malaysia had a birthday, and many of his subjects apparently went to Thailand to celebrate it. So had to stand in a line for one hour to obtain the entry stamp. (We already had a 60-day visa that we had received in Georgetown.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Hat Yai got off the shuttle bus and took an intercity bus to Phatthalung (พัทลุง), an entry point to the Thale Noi lake that Csilla insisted on seeing. The bus dropped us somewhere at the edge of the town and the driver pointed us to a pickup truck that was just about to leave to Thale Noi. These pickup trucks seem to be the core of the public transportation here. Similar to public transportation in many places of the world, they are overloaded with passengers, some travel outside the passenger compartment hanging somehow to the side railings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one hour the truck was in Thale Noi. It's off-season now so most of the aquatic birds that the lake is famous for had flown somewhere else --- the lake that would otherwise be white with egrets was now simply black with mud, with some patches of pink water lilies. The village by the lake is a domestic tourist destination, the only foreigners that we met were a group of geography students from Singapore, sent here to study the tourism potential of the lake. (The best idea would be to get Lonely Planet writing about it, currently Lonely Planet Thailand 2007 doesn't even mention it, so all the international overlanding tourists who arrive from Malaysia will go straight to Phuket.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of the little international tourism, nobody speaks English and all the signs are only in the Thai script. So we walked along the main road looking for a hotel, probably missing several of them, since the only word we know in Thai is พัทลุง (Phatthalung). Ended up at the other end of the village, about 1km away from the center, where we finally found a hotel. The signs there didn't contain any Latin characters either but a friend? of the owner? enthusiastically dragged us in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise over the lake this morning was impressive. We arranged with a local boat man to take us on a tour on a lake (2h for 2per = 400 Baht). One can see quite many birds (egrets, jacanas, kingfishers, cormorants, eagles) but only from a distance because the noise from the engine of the boat scares them away. Was nevertheless quite a pleasant trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have now arrived back to Phattalung and are killing time in an internet place till our overnight train to Krung Thep (i.e. Bangkok).</description>

The ferry was almost empty, probably everybody else flies this distance as the prices offered by Lion Air and Air Asia are almost the same as the ferry prices. Also, the Medan airport is right in the middle of Medan, so when flying one does not need to take a minibus to the Belawan port (duration 2h!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgetown is pleasant: there is no traffic chaos as in Indonesia, people speak better English, there is free wireless, no giggling schoolgirls who call you "Hello Misterrr!", etc. Even the climate felt acceptable when we arrived yesterday, but based on today this was probably misleading. Only beer is unacceptably expensive, so switched to drinking fruit juices, counted 30 different kinds at one stall (Tangerine/Sour plum was a bit too sour for my taste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now thinking how to best visit Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam. These are our constraints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;we are now in Georgetown, Malaysia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;at some point we need to end up in Bangkok to catch a flight to Bombay (flexible date)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we have about 1.5 months to spend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the entry regulations to each of these four countries are complex, e.g. not every border can be crossed with an e-visa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we want to visit Buddha and Hindu temples, relax on beaches, trek in national parks, see animals (e.g. Irrawaddy dolphins), visit indigenous tribes, ride on railways and rivers, learn the rice growing technology, buy a new cell phone cheap, etc., etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Dear readers, if you have suggestions for the most optimal itinerary through these 4 countries, please let us know.</description>

The trekking was not that hard, although we only went up and down the hills, as the paths do not run in the valleys. It was very hot and humid, so we were soaked in sweat after only 5 minutes. The surface was quite slippery and the tracks run often very steep, sometimes we had to climb by holding on to the roots of the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/TAUBnprWYkI/AAAAAAAADZo/-v0ry9dt1Xo/s1600/gunung_leuser_np_day2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="227" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/TAUBnprWYkI/AAAAAAAADZo/-v0ry9dt1Xo/s400/gunung_leuser_np_day2.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were very frequent stops, because the jungle seemed to be full of orangutans. On the first day, we bumped into one every 10 minutes or so. Most of them were semi-wild that were released from the rehabilitation center in the village. Once we met a group of 9 (normally orangutans are solitary...)!! The guides could recognize many of them by their names. We even met the famous "Mina" who has bitten  already 60 people. It actually does not come as a big surprise, because often the poor creatures are surrounded by tourists with no escape route and their bags are smelling so good of bananas, that they used to get from the humans. I would also get aggressive with so many people around me, only wanting my photo without payment... Anyhow, wild or semi-wild, it was cool to watch the orangutans. Especially the babies were very funny, making different noises and doing some acrobatics on the trees.  Interestingly as we got farther from the village on the second day, we did not see any orangutans during the whole day. Actually we did not see any mammal other than a black squirrel. No tiger, no rhino, no elephant... :o( So that was more like real jungle trekking. But on the first day we saw the Thomas leaf monkey, that has a Mohawk hairdo and a few long-tailed macaques. There were giant ants too, much bigger than what we saw in the Amazon region. One even bit our guide and he could hardly pull it off his finger. The other blood thirsty animals were the leeches that sucked themselves to our skin very fast, so it was very difficult to remove them. But at least their bite did not burn, unlike the ones of the mosquitoes...&lt;br /&gt;The night in the jungle was quite uneventful, we had a very nice dinner with 5 different dishes and went to sleep in our bamboo tents. Only monitor lizards came close to the camp to clean up the leftovers. They swallowed the big chicken bones very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the second day we took a raft (inflated car tires bound together) back to the village. It took us almost an hour to get back and went through small rapids, luckily no grade 5...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we took a minivan to Medan with 17 people distributed over 12 seats. Tomorrow we take the ferry to Georgetown in Malaysia and with that begin our continental Asia tour.</description>

It is really not the good weather here for us. Too humid. Too hot. But i guess there is no jungle experience without that... We are on the border of the Gunung Leuser National Park in Northern Sumatra in a small village. It IS very touristy, even some students come here from the main town Medan to celebrate. So last night instead of sleeping we had to listen to a techno party, followed by an Indonesian karaoke that finished only early in the morning. We were quite tired yesterday after the long bus trip under this climate so now we are really exhausted after a sleepless night. Today we looked around in the village, talked to a few locals who organize jungle trekking. One only can enter the Park with a guide, but then it is OK to camp there. So we are now about to book a few days trekking to get a glimpse at wild or semi wild orangutans, siamangs, macaques, hornbills, monitor lizards and turtles. Seeing a Sumatran tiger or a Sumatran rhino is very elusive, although there are a few living in the National Park here.  Still it will be fun to give a try!!</description>

There were some 300 other jeeps, each carrying 6 people, so the viewing platform got quite crowded. (According to our driver it's usually not that crowded, but people seem to have holidays now.) The view was otherwise breathtaking just like Wikitravel promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S_ki9gBlJSI/AAAAAAAADUw/jpIyeRZdhfc/s1600/P1270115.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="245" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S_ki9gBlJSI/AAAAAAAADUw/jpIyeRZdhfc/s400/P1270115.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then climbed Mount Bromo again (had done it already yesterday, but then without the mass of tourists, and the horses that carry them up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at Hotel Yoschi, had breakfast and took a 15-seater minibus to Probolinggo. A few minutes into the journey 7 more tourists were stuck into our bus as theirs had broken down. We were now 19 people + the driver. The caller guy had to travel outside the bus hanging onto the door while the bus was speeding downhill towards Probolinggo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Probolinggo we immediately hopped on a bus to Surabaya. The traffic was crazy, Csilla was in panic throughout the whole journey. The food vendors and bus musicians were around all the time, but as Surabaya is not that far the torture did not last that long. During the journey it turned out that the bus would make the final stop at the main Surabaya bus station which is far from the city centre but quite close to the airport. So we decided to go straight to the airport and try to get a flight to Sumatra in the same evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Surabaya bus station switched immediately to an airport bus. At the airport tried to buy a flight to Medan, but today's flights were already sold out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So will spend the night in a hotel near the airport (under the landing path, it seems) and will fly to Sumatra tomorrow morning. This will be our final planned equator crossing, taking us to the northern hemisphere.</description>

Will leave Jogja in 1h on a shuttle bus to the Cemoro Lawang (10h journey). From there we visit the Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park (desert + many volcanoes, some inside other volcanoes). Looking forward to the cooler highland temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what have we been doing in Jogja:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Sultan's Palace (includes a gamelan+puppet show). Didn't learn much as all the descriptions in Indonesian (and Javanese?). Sultan likes to wear elvish ears, why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited a puppet factory. Similar flat shadow puppets as we saw in the Wayang Museum in Jakarta, but now saw closely how they are produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited several batik studios. It's hard to avoid these as all the locals insist that one buys a batik. Learned a bit about the batik-technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Maliboro Mall and played &lt;i&gt;Dance Dance Revolution&lt;/i&gt; (I've always wanted to play this game) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Pakualaman Palace. Pakualaman is a smaller kind of sultan (also wears elvish ears). Need to research its function more on Wikipedia, the adjacent museum had all the descriptions in local languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Biology Museum (many stuffed local animals, incl. Malaysian Flying Lemur + skeleton of a dugong)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visited the Bird Market (in addition to birds, many caged gekos, bats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, dogs, crickets, snakes, worms). The bats are the most impressive, in Australia and PNG they always flew too high to be easily observed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saw the open air ballet of the Ramayana story at the Prambanan temples. Beautiful costumes and excellent arrow shooting skills of the central actors. Fortunately didn't rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It should be the dry season by now, but the daily rain&amp;nbsp;would not stop. Got lucky this morning and had no precipitation during&amp;nbsp;our early morning visit to Borobudur (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur&lt;/a&gt;), the largest Buddhist temple in&amp;nbsp;South-East Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_V6SBahcRkNY/S_JhY0axD0I/AAAAAAAABh0/BbYXibkt4fQ/s1600/borobudur.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472543576224239426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_V6SBahcRkNY/S_JhY0axD0I/AAAAAAAABh0/BbYXibkt4fQ/s320/borobudur.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 298px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Got there for the opening of the gates at 6 am. Was a good idea as&amp;nbsp;there were hardly any tourists and only a few early bird stalkers. The&amp;nbsp;temple was very impressive! Really big! It takes almost 5 km to&amp;nbsp;circle around all the 10 floors, during which one can admire 504&amp;nbsp;Buddha statues. The setting is also beautiful with many&amp;nbsp;volcanoes&amp;nbsp;around, one was even smoking! We had a guide for an hour who explained&amp;nbsp;us a lot about the Buddhist symbolism that is everywhere in the&amp;nbsp;temple.&lt;br /&gt;On the top floor there were many kids from a local English language school, wanting&amp;nbsp;to practice their language skills with foreigners under the watchful&amp;nbsp;eyes of their teachers, as it was also a part of their final exam. Of&amp;nbsp;course they also wanted to get their pictures taken with us. People&amp;nbsp;are just crazy here for photos with &lt;i&gt;muzungus&lt;/i&gt;...  Later today Kaarel&amp;nbsp;even got a baby pushed into his hands... just for a pic.. Now he would&amp;nbsp;not take off his "funny hat" as he thinks that it is what gives the&amp;nbsp;locals the kick. Most of the kids said they would put the photos to&amp;nbsp;their facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Borobudur, we visited a Hindu temple complex Prambanan (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V6SBahcRkNY/S_Jg1fziIxI/AAAAAAAABhk/hgP7gwSDqY8/s1600/prambanan.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5472542969395553042" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V6SBahcRkNY/S_Jg1fziIxI/AAAAAAAABhk/hgP7gwSDqY8/s320/prambanan.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 312px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also quite impressive and again we were accompanied by&amp;nbsp;students, keen on practicing their English. This time they were some&amp;nbsp;sort of trainees, and knew quite a lot about the temples, so they&amp;nbsp;escorted us during our whole visit. It is quite interesting that even&amp;nbsp;though their speaking skills are quite good, their listening&amp;nbsp;comprehension is quite bad, as they could hardly understand any of our&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Yogya otherwise many people speak quite ok English. It is much&amp;nbsp;smaller and more touristy than Jakarta, so it is not so surprising&amp;nbsp;after all. It has also the negative effects of the stalkers who are&amp;nbsp;also more aggressive, almost as much as in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we will probably visit the city and think about which volcano&amp;nbsp;to climb. Javanese ballet is also on schedule, but maybe only the day&amp;nbsp;after tomorrow.</description>

Yesterday Monas (Monument Nasional) --- a huge tower in the middle of a huge square. After standing for an hour in a huge line, we could take a tiny lift (+/- 11 persons) to the top. Not much was visible (e.g. couldn't even see the sea properly) as there is too much smog. Then visited the largest mosque in South-East Asia (can hold up to 250,000 people during Ramadan). While we were there only a few people had come to take a nap escaping the hot/humid environment outside. Then observed a wedding in a Catholic church just across the street from the mosque. (Crossing this street took about 30 minutes, the traffic here is crazy and the city planners haven't done enough for the pedestrian, there are no sidewalks nor zebra crossings). Then took a tuk-tuk back to the Jalan Jaksa district where we currently stay, and fell asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today took a tuk-tuk to the Kota district. Hot and humid again. Ate an extremely spicy &lt;i&gt;nasi ayam&lt;/i&gt; and drank a hot (!) orange juice. Was covered by sweat all over the body. Then visited the Wayang Museum (Javan puppetry) which was nicely air-conditioned. The Javan puppet tradition includes some 300 puppets which are all related in a complex genealogy. The puppets are flat, made of buffalo skin, full of holes to allow for a light-and-shadow play, painted on both sides in several bright colors, their hands can be manipulated by the puppeteer. The visit includes a puppet show which can be viewed from two sides, the shadow side and the "color" side. The performance is accompanied by an annoying percussion music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then walked to Sunda Kelapa (800-year old port) where a large number of large wooden ships were lined up by the quay. It started raining (it's been raining on and off all day). Wanted to take a tuk-tuk to a big Chinese temple (recommended to us by a puppet painter at the Wayang Museum) but failed to communicate this to our driver. So ended up at the Kota train station from where took a train to the Gambir station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions of Indonesia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;very cheap (transportation, hotels, food);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;very good food, e.g. &lt;i&gt;nasi goreng&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;ayam&lt;/i&gt; (fried rice with chicken) which I learned to like already 4 years ago in Malaysia;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;people think that my hat is funny;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;people like to have their picture taken posing next to a tourist (they probably publish these photos on Facebook).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Tomorrow will take a 8h train to Yogyakarta.</description>

We were here in 2006 when we took the scenic railway up to Kuranda and visited some nearby beaches (Trinity?). This time we just hung out by the pool of the hostel, went to movies once (Kickass), and to the free dinner (a simple pasta dish) at the Woolshed pub every evening. Tomorrow will fly all day, first to Sydney, and from there directly to Jakarta to start the last continent (Asia) on our trip.</description>

People speak English (the newspapers are all in English), there is no white man in sight (unless you go in to a fancier hotel, e.g. Bird of Paradise in Goroka), there are dala-dalas, market places look like a big pile of garbage, roadside produce stands feature fruits arranged in pyramid shape, people walk on the road, long distances, barefoot, to school or to work, men hold hands (sign of friendship?), roadside ads show the presence of cell phone networks, soap companies, Coca-Cola, and AIDS, people walk around in colorful clothing. The men look hostile with their beards and machetes (bush knife, as it is called here), and spitting red betelnut spit through their black teeth. But once you smile and wave and say "Abenun" ("Good Afternoon" in Tok Pisin), their respond by smiling and waving and saying "Abenun". The people are very welcoming in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least this is the case in the Highlands. Tomorrow will go to Madang on the coast.</description>

On the way visited the Royal National Park, Sri Venkateswara Temple and Nan Tien Temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before booked a 10-day trip to Papua New Guinea (PNG) with &lt;a href="http://www.nghols.com/"&gt;Niugini Holidays&lt;/a&gt;. It's a custom-made tour taking into consideration our preferences not to spend (too much) time on the beaches and not to visit WWII sites, but rather the tribes and the village- and wildlife in the Highlands. Also the budget and safety concerns shaped the outcome quite much, e.g. we won't have domestic flights landing into fog-filled valleys where the pilot would have difficulties finding the runway, and the lodges where we stay have staff that is exclusively composed of non-cannibals. For reasons of high cost we decided to skip climbing Mt. Wilhelm and not to go to see the wigmen tribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the current (final?) schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight: Cairns -&amp;gt; Port Moresby -&amp;gt; Mt. Hagen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nature walks around Kumul Lodge to spot birds of paradise, orchids and marsupials&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transfer to Magic Mountain Lodge (via Mt. Hagen)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Village visits; Sing sing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Motor Vehicle (PMV): Mt. Hagen -&amp;gt; Goroka&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the Asaro Mudmen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PMV: Goroka -&amp;gt; Madang&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit villages around Madang&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit islands and snorkel around Madang&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight: Madang -&amp;gt; Port Moresby -&amp;gt; Cairns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;This afternoon will fly to Cairns.</description>

At 6AM participated in the Dawn Service at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Lots of people and the live video screen was placed too low, so didn't see much. Speeches were delivered by the Mayor of Auckland, the Minister of Defence and a couple of war veterans. The service was in English with little bits also in Maori. A plane was supposed to fly over the park but this was cancelled due to thick fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S9QIQjOrE0I/AAAAAAAAEJI/CcZCqWKu1Lg/s1600/P1250138-746245.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5464001328334967618" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S9QIQjOrE0I/AAAAAAAAEJI/CcZCqWKu1Lg/s320/P1250138-746245.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Then went on to the Auckland Zoo to check out the kiwi bird. Kiwi can be viewed in two places, in the BNZ Kiwi &amp;amp; Tuatara House, and during the NZ Fauna Keeper Encounter. As the kiwi is a nocturnal bird, to show an active kiwi, the BNZ House is dark, so one doesn't see much. The NZ Fauna Keeper Encounter takes place in day-light. A zoo keeper demonstrates various animals endemic to New Zealand: tuatara, some bird, and a green geko. The kiwi sleeps under a tree trunk throughout the show and appears as the highlight of the show when the keeper pulls away the trunk. It takes a while till the bird wakes up. It then pecks on some sweet-corn and finally runs away (kiwis can run faster than humans over short distances).</description>

The walk goes through residential areas with white-painted wooden houses and impeccable lawns; the dormant volcanoes Maungakiekie (One Tree Hill), Maungawhai (Mt. Eden), and the Auckland Domain which offer an overview of the city; rugby/cricket fields where along rugby and cricket players Harry Potter fans are playing Quiddish (?); large parks (e.g. Cornwall Park); and Auckland University buildings.

      <description>Published by Kaarel in 2010-04-20T12:42:00.001-07:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2010/04/port-papeete-tahiti.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>At the Papeete port again, using a free wireless...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday (2010-04-19) visited the Gauguin Museum at the other end of the island some 55km from Papeete. The way the public buses work here is confusing and unreliable, so it took us 3 hours to reach the museum and to come back we had to hitchhike because the last bus back to Papeete seemed to have left already at 14.30. After 10 minutes of hitchhiking we got picked up by a nice Chinese businessman (2nd generation Tahitian) who seemed to own everything on the island, from flower farms and quarries to supermarkets and pearl shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the museum we learned that Gauguin was obsessed with his Peruvian ancestors which made him consider himself half-savage, the nature which he tried to explore and connect to more in French Polynesia. Upon arriving there the Polynesia was unfortunately already too French. Gauguin had a wife and 5 kids but for the most part of his life they seemed to be living in Denmark away from Gauguin (the wife was Danish).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, his paintings are interesting, mixing motifs from different cultures, consider e.g. Le Grande Buddha (1899) which features the Last Supper, Buddha, a Maori woodcarving, two Tahitian ladies, and a dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day before yesterday (2010-04-18) traveled for 9 hours from Bora Bora back to Papeete. The ferry King Tamatoa is new and comfortable but the food on-board is expensive and comes in tiny quantities and the audio-video program consists of the same hula-girl show played over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bora Bora is a small island (38 km2) with a big tourist industry (1218 hotel/pension rooms). The big and expensive resorts (Four Seasons, InterContinental, Sofitel, etc.) are mostly located off the main island on the smaller &lt;i&gt;motus&lt;/i&gt; (islets) surrounding the main island on the coral reef. The people who stay there probably never visit the main island as they are shipped to the resort directly from the airport (located on another &lt;i&gt;motu&lt;/i&gt;), unless of course they choose to dine out at the Bloody Mary's restaurant which has hosted many celebrities over the years, from Kareem Abdul Jabbar to Sen. John McCain (240 names are listed by the front entrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 2010-04-17 bought the snorkeling equipment (it was not possible to rent it anywhere) and biked around the island (35km) looking for a nice beach. Unfortunately, the nice beach is only found on the southern tip of the island, where all the resorts and pensions are as well, so one cannot find a solitary beach experience on Bora Bora...&lt;br /&gt;(While snorkeling on the main public beach saw two manta (?) rays hovering over the bottom of the lagoon. One can easily spot them from the distance because the water is so clear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huahine came much closer to paradise. It is bigger in area (74 km2) but much less developed touristically (236 hotel/pension rooms). We had a private bungalow on the beach on the south coast of the island. One could take a kayak, paddle out into the lagoon, and dip into the clear and shallow water. (It was difficult to swim by the beach because of many sharp dead corals and sea urchins.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 2010-04-15 rented a scooter and biked around the island. There is quite a lot to see considering the size of the island: a vanilla plantation, a pearl farm, tame eels that eat from your palm, old stone platforms for human sacrifice (marae). The local people are friendly, smiling and waving all the time.</description>

Our goal here is to find the paradise-feeling that Tahiti and its neighbouring islands are supposed to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two days here (Papeete, Tahiti) were spent on arranging a week-long visit to three of the islands: Tahiti, Huahine, and Bora Bora. There are approx. 100 islands here, this choice was partly random, partly guided by tourist agencies, partly determined by our budget. This is the final plan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-14 (Wed): Ferry: Tahiti → Huahine (0800–1210); check in to a &lt;i&gt;pension&lt;/i&gt;; snorkel and/or relax on the beach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-15 (Thu): Visit a pearl farm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-16 (Fri): Snorkel and relax; ferry: Huahine → Bora Bora (1230–1640); check in to a &lt;i&gt;pension&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-17 (Sat): Bike around Bora Bora&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-18 (Sun): Ferry: Bora Bora → Tahiti (1200–2040)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-19 (Mon): Hike up to Mount Orohena (2241m)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-20 (Tue): Visit the white sandy beaches and the Gauguin museum (on the South side of Tahiti)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2010-04-21 (Wed): Flight: Papeete → Auckland (with Air Tahiti Nui), 7000–1055 (arrives the following day because crosses the date line)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Making the required bookings has taken pretty much all of our time, only yesterday afternoon had finally a chance to go to a beach, a black sand beach at Pointe Venus. No paradise-feeling there: it looked like a mud field where children play and pigeons wrestle with a piece of half-eaten baguette. (The water was warm and super clear though.)</description>

Activities done today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Had a sumptuous breakfast at the hostel, including sausage and eggs and no traces of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;comida tradicional&lt;/span&gt; (spaghetti + rice + beans).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Called British Airways (BA) because discovered that our tomorrow's flight to Santiago had disappeared from the BA online booking system. Now it's fixed and we are flying tomorrow at 10am to connect in Santiago to a flight to Easter Island. (It is remarkable how often we have to communicate with BA regarding our round-the-world ticket. Sometimes it's because we want to shift our flight dates, but more often it's because the online list of our future flights has got messed up, and most often because BA calls to inform us that the time of our flight from Helsinki to Budapest (which is going to happen sometime in July according to the current optimistic schedule) has changed by 10 minutes...)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posted 4.8kg of stuff to Europe (107 BRL including the box). These are the useless kilos that we have gained during the 4.5 months here. It's mostly paper (brochures, maps), but also coins for my coin collection, gifts, and some Yerba Mate (which will probably be classified as gift). The estimated time of arrival is in 15 days, so the package probably won't beat the record currently held by a wooden giraffe whose journey from Lilongwe to Utrecht lasted 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's raining in São Paulo (although not as heavily as in Rio where it's flooding) so we haven't planned any activities for the evening. Will probably try to have lunch now in the vegetarian restaurant Apfel (that is only open for lunch) and then drink a "good bye" Caipirinha.</description>

The new visa allows me to stay here for 15 days, which is a bit weird because the consulate usually issues 30-day visas. I was afraid to ask them for an explanation, but 15 days should be enough anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to stay another night in the small and cosy Puerto Iguazu and left early Tuesday morning for Brazil. Entering Brazil went smoothly. Ended up in Foz do Iguaçu. This town offers two attractions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Iguazu (or Iguaçu) Falls, i.e. the same falls that we already saw from the Argentinian side, so decided to skip them, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Itaipu power plant, the world's largest hydro powerplant (by some criteria), on the border between Brazil and Paraguay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S7Px5fqK23I/AAAAAAAAEHc/-tQcr8Ef_Ao/s1600/P1230010.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5454969543729011570" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S7Px5fqK23I/AAAAAAAAEHc/-tQcr8Ef_Ao/s320/P1230010.JPG" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" title="Spillway in action" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took the &lt;a href="http://www.itaipu.gov.br/index.php?q=en/node/218"&gt;Special Tour&lt;/a&gt; to see the dam. The tour was very well organized, and the guide spoke fluent English and seemed to be knowledgeable about all the aspects of this massive construction and its history. Visually the most impressive part of the dam is the spillway (gets rid of extra water in the reservoir) which was half-open while we were there (it is completely closed for 90% of the year). The spillway rivals the Iguazu falls in impressiveness, but strangely very few tourists were around. People seem to prefer nature to human creation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 8pm took a night bus to Campo Grande, arrived here around 10am today morning. Campo Grande did not look that fascinating so been relaxing at the hostel (which has a pool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will go to the Pantanal for 3 days / 2 nights (maybe will stay one night extra). The activities there include: boat trips, piranha fishing, hiking, jeep safaris, spotlight safaris. The main goal is to see a jaguar. After Pantanal will go directly to São Paulo and spend there our last days on the South American continent.</description>

The Brazilian consulate in Puerto Iguazú later interpreted the stamps in my passport in the same way. (Btw, did you know that the Brazilian visa allocates two pages, and an entry or exit stamp half a page in your passport.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked them to contact the Brazilian embassy in Helsinki who had issued the visa which I have been interpreting as compatible with my (detailed) application letter (= I plan to travel in South America for a longer period of time with an entry and exit via São Paulo, separated by at least 3 months, i.e. at least two entries, each entry about 3 weeks long but the time between entries at least 90 days), namely that each of the multiple entries that I will make can last up to 60 days. Both the border control and the consulate refused to contact the embassy in Helsinki and offered as the only solution that I apply for a new visa. This is possible during weekdays between 8am and 11am, Friday was already too late, next opportunity is on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is humiliating, and costs money (85 ARS = 22 USD) and time (at least 3 days). I've tried to contact various offices to get help (i.e. an apology and a speedier entry into Brazil) but failed, most importantly, the embassy in Helsinki only opens on Monday. Fortunately our round-the-world ticket is flexible, i.e. we can shift the dates of the flights.</description>

Back to the heat, humidity, mosquitoes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today visited the (Argentinian side of the) Iguazu Falls. The idea was to be the first tourist of the day to reach the Garganta del Diablo (Devil's Throat), the most impressive of the multiple falls in the Iguazú National Park. To achieve that we woke up at 6, took the 7 o'clock bus (10 ARS round-trip pp) to the park, waited there for 30 minutes until the gate was opened (8am) and tickets were started to be sold (85 ARS pp for foreigners). Then took the first miniature train to the Garganta. From the train's end station it is a 15 minute walk over the river to the fall. Some speed-walking was necessary to beat the trainful of people (the train was packed as many people had shown up for the opening of the park). Unfortunately three people where already there, on the final platform over the Garganta. Had they run faster than the train? Had they sneaked into the park before the opening time? Where they staying at the Sheraton (which is in the park)? We didn't ask...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wixA-DDVI/AAAAAAAAEFY/0ekMe4-76W8/s1600/P1220765.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452771474308009298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wixA-DDVI/AAAAAAAAEFY/0ekMe4-76W8/s320/P1220765.JPG" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" title="Arrival at the Garganta, very few people still, this will change within the next 5 minutes." border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then visited the series of falls, viewable from multiple platforms above and under the falls. All the tourists had arrived by then, walking around was therefore slowed down and it was impossible to take photos with just the falls on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The falls are impressive (although maybe not as much as the Victoria Falls), the highlight of the day however was a group of coatis who were stealing food from people at the restaurant area. Coatis are incredibly cute animals, so people have been feeding them (although this is violating the park's rules) making them brave and thus turning them into pests (although still cute).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wla9csbuI/AAAAAAAAEFg/DX-c73dfL_8/s1600/P1220888.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452774393940569826" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wla9csbuI/AAAAAAAAEFg/DX-c73dfL_8/s320/P1220888.JPG" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" title="A team of two coatis stealing bread from a table" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished the day in the park (closing time 5pm) with a walk on the Macuco trail to the Arrechea falls. As this trail is longer (3km one way) and less interesting (it goes through the forest full of spiders and butterflies but no waterfalls), it is also less touristic. Below the Arrechea falls is a natural pool which offered a refreshing swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wnncp3qTI/AAAAAAAAEFo/V7ivWgZu1fU/s1600/P1220936.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5452776807499016498" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S6wnncp3qTI/AAAAAAAAEFo/V7ivWgZu1fU/s320/P1220936.JPG" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 320px; text-align: center; width: 240px;" title="Cooling off below the Arrechea falls" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will cross the border to Brazil, visit the Itaipu power plant and then go on to the Pantanal, hopefully with an overnight bus.</description>

Landing at the Jorge Newbery airport in the middle of the city was impressive with the city lights extending to as far as eyes could see. Took the bus 45 (1.25 ARS pp.) and checked into a random hostel (Telmotango) in San Telmo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday moved into Hostel Inn (a HI hostel) a few blocks from Telmotango. It was raining till the evening, so got soaked wet while exploring the antiquity market around Plaza Dorrego and the pedestrian-only streets between Plaza de Mayo and the Obelisco. In fact, it was raining so heavily that the "superclassico" football match &lt;span class="inside-head"&gt;Boca Juniors vs. River Plate was called off after 10 minutes of play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then met Tobias and sampled various Argentinian meats and beers till 2 o'clock in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plans for today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the corrugated iron sheet&lt;a href="http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;amp;search=sheet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wellblech&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;laineplekk&lt;/span&gt;?) houses in La Boca&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit places related to J.

Thank God by plane, otherwise it would be a rough more than 48 hours bus ride. Today the 200 years of anniversary of Argentina starts here in Ushuaia and a few huge sailing boats arrived to the port from all over the world to participate. This morning we will take a look at them and maybe also visit the prison museum here.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we had a nice day hike in the Tierra del Fuego National Park. It resembled a Nordic forest in Europe. Finally we have seen the typical autumn mushrooms there which I missed so much in Torres del Paine. It was strange to have the many berries over there without the mushrooms. Here the landscape was not that awe inspiring as in Torres del Paine, but still was very nice. The highlight was to pass by a beaver colony. It was on a small creek and all the trees on the shore were chewed down by these creatures and they made small damns out of them on the creek. Unfortunately we did not see the beavers themselves. But we have seen quite many birds (Magellanic woodpecker, kelp goose, sea gulls, cormorants, skuas, chimango caracara, ringed kingfisher etc.) and Kaarel's favourites, the rabbits. Some of them were very tame and we fed one some apples.&lt;br /&gt;We reached the southernmost point of our trip in the park there.</description>

The bus crossed 2 borders --- Argentina-Chile (this took long as the Chileans always scan your bags for plant and animal products) and Chile-Argentina --- and on the ferry the Strait of Magellan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ushuaia is another tourist-oriented town. Today will go and look for to the feeling of the "end of the world", e.g. I'd like to take the GPS and go as far south as possible and amidst snowy mountains find a remote hut where a few remaining naked Yamana Indians drink 55-degree vodka. Unlikely that this will happen, so will probably just do laundry and look for a cheap flight to Buenos Aires.</description>

Didn't try their creppes as they were more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El Calafate is a small clean tourist-oriented town: lots of cafeterias, boutiques, restaurants, travel agencies. We spent some time finding out how much is the flight ticket from Ushuaia to Buenos Aires, as we don't really want to travel 48h by bus. The cheap airline is called LADE, we walked to their office at the edge of the town (the town is really small, so the edge arrived quickly). Unfortunately, the whole March had been sold out, and they fly only on Fridays anyway. So we might fly with Aerolineas Argentinas, which is a &amp;nbsp;bit more expensive (around 210 USD) than the bus but will save us a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will go to Rio Gallegos in 1 hour, and from there to Ushuaia tomorrow. Expected to arrive at "the end of the world" at 8pm tomorrow.</description>

After seeing the other blue and large Patagonian glaciers, Pio XI and Glacier Grey, Perito Moreno is not that surprising any more, but is probably the most impressive one.&lt;br /&gt;The glacier has the height of a 20-storey building and every 10 minute or so a large piece of it falls off and splashes into the water. The glacier can be viewed only from the distance as it would be too dangerous to go close (between 1968 and 1988 32 people died being hit on the head by a piece of ice).&lt;br /&gt;We have been here already for 4 hours and almost finished a bottle of Pisco Sour (0.7l, 20 deg, 1750 CLP at UniMarc in Puerto Natales). Will go back to El Calafate in an hour (20.30) and then think what to do next.</description>

Fought strong winds, heavy rain, snow, and intense sun (which comes straight through a hole in the ozone layer). Saw blue glaciers, icebergs, weird rock formations, rivers, lakes, animals (guanaco, fox), birds, and plants many of which grow also in Estonia (&lt;i&gt;v6ilill&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;karikakar&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ristikhein&lt;/i&gt;).

People drive Dodge and Chevrolet pick up trucks. All the modern facilities (ATM, WiFi, supermarket, good pavement) are here because travellers from all around the world start their multi-day hikes to the Torres del Paine national park from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived here yesterday afternoon after 4-days/3-nights of sailing through the desolate Patagonian landscapes: there was cell phone signal for only 15 minutes close to S45.2 / W73.7. Otherwise the only human presence that we encountered was in Puerto Eden (200 inhabitants): the only place in Chile where one can buy handicraft made of sea lions. Because of bad weather (rain and wind) however, the&lt;br /&gt;crew did not let us off shore to visit the village. The nature was a bit monotone and less impressive that I hoped for (Kaarel says that, Csilla was very much impressed): forest covered islands and peninsulas, kind of like in Finland, but with snowy mountains in the background. What was big and impressive however was the intense blue Pio XI glacier (the boat made a detour into the Fjord Eyre to visit it), part of which cracked and splashed into the water in front of our eyes. In terms of animals we saw sea lions, dolphins, even a killer whale (very rare!, spotted by Csilla), cormorants (who look like penguins), and penguins (who were maybe actually cormorants, Csilla: no they were not, they were penguins!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ferry provided more than just transportation from Puerto Montt to Puerto Natales: there were a few lectures on fauna and glaciers (also in English), movies, a salsa party and we could also visit the bridge to see the radars and GPSs. Food was good on the ferry and we had a 4-person cabin only for ourselves, as the other 2 passengers did not show up. Most of the people on the boat were non-Chileans: a large group of German students and a few French, Dutch and Americans. (The Germans completely ruled the Bingo competition on the last night.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we will go on a (probably) 5-day hike in the Torres del Paine, to do the so called W-track there. So won't be online before Sunday.</description>

Takes 4 days/3 nights to get there. The ferry passes through fjords so the views should be magnificent. Around Puerto Natales will try to do some hiking (Torres del Paine, Los Glaciares) to see more magnificent landscapes, then go to Ushuaia to visit the southernmost town in the world (at least according to the Argentinians). (Note that Puerto Montt is situated already more south than we have been before during this trip, the Cape of Good Hope was the previous record holder.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Montt is much different from other South American towns that we have visited. It's late summer here, smells of hay, houses are made of wood, some streets almost resemble Tartu. And there is nothing to do here except for surfing in the internet. Will go to buy some wine now as it might get boring on the ferry after the first impressions of the passing fjords have worn off.</description>

Mendoza is a nice European-looking town, surrounded by massive vineyards. In a couple of days the annual wine festival will start, today there was only a little festival on Plaza Italia to honor Italy many of whose people have come to live in Mendoza over the years. From nine to ten o'clock the police brass orchestra played and some opera arias were sung, as well as an Argentinian war song which everybody in the audience sang along. I tried to buy a cup of (Italian?) wine (for 2 pesos, i.e. 0.5 USD) but nobody had change from 50 pesos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying at a hostel that offers free wireless and free wine. (The wine tastes horrible.) Tomorrow will have to check out already at 10.30. Our overnight bus to the next destination Bariloche is at 20.00.</description>

The street leading to the villa is filled with cats and nicely smelling trees (one was an orange tree, the names of the others I don't know). The accommodation is the most expensive one that we have had so far, 11,000 CLP (21 USD) per person in a private double room without a bathroom (but a basic breakfast is included, and there is wireless internet and one can use the kitchen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S4yVB3nWSSI/AAAAAAAAEBw/BzLJ2tzGa5o/s1600-h/P1210030.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5443889908925483298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S4yVB3nWSSI/AAAAAAAAEBw/BzLJ2tzGa5o/s320/P1210030.JPG" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 240px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today walked around in Valparaíso, mostly climbing up and down from &lt;i&gt;cerro&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. hill) to &lt;i&gt;cerro&lt;/i&gt;. Many artists seem to live in Valparaíso, every second building in the hills is covered with graffiti, there are small restaurants and cafeterias.&lt;br /&gt;Very few signs indicate that an earthquake hit this area just two days ago: at the port the pavement was cracked a bit, and the facade of several buildings has fallen off and some sidewalks have been sealed off for that reason. In the hills many of the buildings are old and shabby but strangely the earthquake doesn't seem to have harmed them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally ended up at the bus station and tried to buy a bus ticket to Puerto Montt for tomorrow. All companies except for one claimed that the roads are broken and at the moment there is no service to the South. So we decided to buy tickets to Mendoza (Argentina) and will try to reach Patagonia from the Argentinian side, i.e. on the other side of the Andes.</description>

San Pedro is a nice little town with white houses and unpaved streets (probably on purpose, to make it look cuter). It's very expensive here: a bed in a dorm room costs 16 USD, cheapest menu lunch 10 USD. Hopefully it's because San Pedro is a remote desert town, the rest of Chile is maybe cheaper.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's summer in San Pedro (compared to the almost 5000m heights that we reached on the way here), so switched to flip-flops, had two beers and biked to Valle de la Luna (28km round trip) to watch the sunset. As it's full moon now, the moon would have been even more impressive than the sun and fit better with the surreal landscape of the valley but clouds covered it and the park closing time is already at 21.00 which makes the proper moon watching impossible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Will take a 24h bus to Santiago this evening. There was just a 8.8 scale earthquake close to it, so it's probably not the best time to visit...&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The distance between Potosi and Uyuni is just some 150km but the road goes through the mountains, is mostly a dirt road, a long lunch break is made, then the bus breaks down, and also the bus driver likes to make long stops to talk to the bus drivers of buses coming from Uyuni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Haven't seen much of Uyuni but there&amp;nbsp;doesn't seem to be&amp;nbsp;that much to see anyway. Yesterday checked into a cheap hotel (Palace) and then&amp;nbsp;booked (for today) a 3-days/2-nights tour through the &lt;i&gt;salar&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;lagunas&lt;/i&gt; to San Pedro de Atacama (Chile). Took the company Colqa Tours which many other travellers recommeded. There will be 3-4 people in the same jeep&amp;nbsp;in addition&amp;nbsp;us. The tour will go through all the important places: the train cemetary, the salt hotel, Isla del Pescado, salt mines, geysers, volcanoes, flamingo lagoons, hot springs, until to the border of Chile where we get transported to San Pedro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This morning got the Bolivian exit stamp (costs 21 Bs per person for some reason), and in 1h will start the journey. Probably won't be able to connect to the internet for the next 2 or 3 days.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The bus (Trans Copacabana) was quite comfortable with wide reclinable seats + blankets were provided because the nights are cold at this altitude (&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt; is the highest city in the world, at 4090m).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt; is a mining town, e.g. you can walk into a grocery store and buy dynamite (including the fuse it costs just 15 Bs). Took a Koala Tours to visit one of the mines. (Why such a name "Koala Tours", you might wonder. Explanation: the koala chews eucalyptus leaves, while miners chew coca leaves...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour was fascinating, but quite scary, including crawling from level to level through narrow and dusty tunnels, and seeing and talking to miners many of whom seemed depressed and exhausted. For a longer description of the mining techniques and working conditions in &lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt; see the &lt;a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Potosi"&gt;Wikitravel's article on &lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Csilla meanwhile decided to spend time checking out &lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt;'s colonial churches many of which were unfortunately closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some &lt;span style="font-size: 100%;"&gt;Potosí&lt;/span&gt; photos are &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/trip20092010/Potosi"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Tomorrow will go on, but haven't decided yet to where.</description>

Before the climb I had the following goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 15px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;reach higher than Csilla's El Misti 5822m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 15px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;make a new altitude record, i.e. reach higher than the Uhuru peak on Kilimanjaro, 5895m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 15px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;reach higher than 6000m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="margin-left: 15px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;reach the top of Huayna Potosí (6088m)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;The last goal was in a way quite arbitrary as the first time I had heard about Huayna Potosí was 2 weeks ago from a French guy who was climbing El Misti with us. So I wasn't very unhappy when we turned around at &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;6014m&lt;/span&gt; (measured by my GPS which can be a bit inaccurate when it comes to measuring altitude) after 5h of gaining 700m in deep snow. Yes, we were well acclimatized and healthy but the weather played a trick on us --- during the evening heavy snow fall covered the tracks and made walking very tiring. We decided to turn back and save the energy for the way back, which was a good idea because after the sun came out the snow started melting and became very unstable, also further down the hill there are loose rocks which were now covered with melting snow making it quite dangerous to walk on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;Our guide wasn't very good. On the rocks he walked much ahead of us listening to some Aymara radio station. On the snow when we where roped together he kept pulling on the rope to make us go faster so that I felt like a dog on a leash, reminding me the &lt;a href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Ehobbs/matterhorn/" style="color: #406480;" target="_blank"&gt;Matterhorn story by Jerry R. Hobbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 19px;"&gt;There were two other groups besides us --- a Swiss guy and his guide, and an Australian couple + their guide. None of them reached the top today because their guides claimed that the final narrow part to the summit was covered by loose snow making it dangerous to walk on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now available: &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/trip20092010/HuaynaPotosi"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://files.dropbox.com/u/1397729/trip2009/tracks.html"&gt;GPS tracklogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Huayna Potosí is 6088m-high mountain close to La Paz, and is considered to be one of the easiest 6000m mountains in the world. Climbing however requires using crampons and ice-axe, so it can't be that easy. No prior experience is required though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We eventually booked a 3-days/2-nights tour starting tomorrow. First day is spent on driving to the base camp (4700m) and practicing ice climbing there on a glacier. Second day is a short walk (2-3h) from the base camp to the high camp (5300m). Finally, on the third day one starts at 1am towards the summit (6h from the high camp), then goes back to the base camp (4h) and is driven back to La Paz. We should be well acclimatized by now having spent 10 days at altitudes between 3600m and 4000m. Hopefully I will do better this time than I did in Ecuador and Peru.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday started in an annoying way. Spent several hours looking for a laundry service but everything was closed due to the carnival. People were playing with firecrackers (?) (&lt;i&gt;paukpadrun&lt;/i&gt;), every couple of minutes one heard sounds resembling gunshots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the evening was nice with a delicious dinner (incl. potatoes, maize cake) and drinks (wine, cupuacu liquor,  mango+singani cocktail) at Jorge's.</description>

Got a cheap hotel room (50 Bs) right in the center of what seems to be the famous Witches' Market, where people sell dried llama foetuses for good luck. The carneval is going on everywhere: dressed up dance groups, brass bands, children shooting each other from water guns. Had a delicious lunch at a Lebanese restaurant. In 30 minutes will meet Jorge, a friend from Zurich.</description>

There is no wireless, the internet cafes don't allow you to connect your own laptop to the network, or if they do then their network does not support DHCP, and manual configuration fails for some reason. Monitors are tiny and the only available browser is Internet Explorer which often informs you in Spanish that it's going to remember your GMail password now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent today on Isla del Sol, hiking 13km from the North port to the South port along an old Inca trail. There were some Inca ruins but nothing special. The island itself has an interesting shape and is hilly with the highest point some 300m from the level of the lake (3812m). Otherwise the hike is boring: wild nature has been completely removed from the island: just terraced fields (potato, corn, beans), a few eucalyptus trees, donkeys, pigs and cows. The local people are money-hungry, every village has introduced a law that foreign tourists who walk through the village have to pay 5-10 boliviano (approx 1 USD). On our way we walked through 3 villages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get on the island one takes a boat which moves 9 km/h, i.e. even slower than an Amazonian river boat going upriver. It takes more than 2h to reach the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will take an early bus to La Paz.</description>

It's a nice laid-back town by lake Titicaca with many Argentinian hippies and trout-selling restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow, at 8.30 will take a boat to Isla de Sol, the largest island in the lake and the birth place of the Sun and the Inca civilization. Will hike there a few hours, visit some Inca ruins, and then back to mainland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday's highlight was a trip to two different cultures living on lake Titicaca:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the descendents of the Uros people (who speak Aymara now) who build floating reed islands on which they then build their houses. The people are very commercialized, seem to be living entirely on tourists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Quechua people on the Taquile island, who are famous for their textile skills, e.g. all men know how to knit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Csilla summited this morning, in 6h from the base camp. &lt;strong&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to give up after a nightful of freezing in tiny, damp and thin tour company provided sleeping bag (my own sleeping bag has a broken zipper). Also got diarrhea right after dinner. This kept me up all night as well.

This makes the success rate 50% (the same as for a group that went up the day before, whom we met on the way to the base camp). All tour companies in Arequipa claim that the rate is almost 100%. They are liers... :(</description>

It's a nice city with white houses, beautiful Plaza de Armas, and surrounded by several snow-capped volcanoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow will explore the city some more (today spent most of the time sleeping as couldn't properly rest in the overnight Cruz del Sur from Nazca to Arequipa). Then will probably go on a 3-days/2-nights Colca canyon trip. Besides offering views to condors, colonial churches, llamas, and a deep canyon, it also serves as acclimatization, as afterwards we plan to do some volcano climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The local tour companies offer 2-days/1-night trips to both El Misti (5822m; hike starts at 3400m, camp at 4800m) and Chachani (6075m; hike starts at 5000m, camp at 5400m). Both are supposed to be technically easy, i.e. crampons are not needed, ice axe maybe. After talking to several tour companies it stayed unclear which hike would make more sense for us and how much acclimatization we need to do beforehand, sleeping at 5000m should not be taken lightly. (No tour company seems to offer trips that would contain acclimatization days.)</description>

      <description>Published by Csilla in 2010-01-31T17:06:00.000-08:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2010/01/leaving-nazca.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>The  day began early: we  started our sandboarding trip at 3 a.m. We were picked up at the hotel and drove for about 30 min into the mountainous region. We started hiking at an altitude of 1400 m. Luckily it was not pitch dark  at this early hour, because it was full moon. So most part of the hike we did not even need our flashlights. The hike took us 3 hours. The first hour was going up very steep on a rocky surface with many different cactuses. The area is a desert, so either there is no vegetation or only such succulent pants can be found here. The second hour was more or less flat, with little elevation and the third part was the toughest, because then we have reached the sand  dunes. Climbing on a sand dune is very exhausting.  We reached the top for sunrise and finally we saw clearly the surroundings. They were bare  mountain peaks. And in the middle of it was our giant sand dune.  It is a very weird sight, but also amazing. No clue how such a huge amount of sand could have gotten here. Why is there no sand in  the neighbouring area? Where did that sand come from? Please  tell us!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandboarding was not as much fun as it was in Namibia. The equipment was basically a wooden board with textile straps screwed to it as bindings. As for boots we used our hiking boots and as for waxing we had to rub candles to the bottom of the boards. The main problem was that the wax did not last long, so after sliding down some 50 meters the board got stuck on the slope, no matter how steep it was. And believe me the final stretch with an altitude difference of 800 meters was very steep!!! Even if you just sat on the board and tried to use it as a sledge it got stuck... The other problem was that making turns with such an equipment was impossible, not only for us but also for our guide. He actually told us that turns don't work... Not that he was such an expert, but still was more experienced on that terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the sandboarding part was disappointing the trip provided many breathtaking views, so it was worth it. We even saw a desert fox in the morning and a small scorpion on the dunes. After the sandboarding finished we hiked back to the main road where we were picked up and taken back to town. The rest of the day we spent relaxing at a swimming pool of a hotel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once again our bonus question:  how was that giant sand dune of Cerro Blanco formed?</description>

It took so long because for some reason Nazca doesn't really have a sandboarding scene (e.g. there are no sandboarding shops here), and the tour companies all use one and the same guide (Richi), who today wasn't reachable on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;Finally another guide was found. The trip starts tomorrow at 3AM as one cannot do the 3h hike to the top of Cerro Blanco during the day as it would be too hot. So will go to sleep now. Tomorrow evening will go on to Arequipa.</description>

Going to see the Nazca lines in a couple of hours. The sky is foggy at the moment, hope it clears up soon.&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon will visit a pre-Inca cemetery, ceramics factory, gold processing factory, and an aqueduct. So today is full of activities.</description>

It is quite an ugly, dusty small town. Not much to do here. The only thing is to go to the cemetery and pay a visit to the grave of a suspected vampire called Sarah Ellen. She must get a lot of gringo visitors because in the cemetery the locals kept asking us whether we want to see her grave and gave us directions. She must be also popular among the locals because her grave was the one with the most flowers. There were also many small thank you notes hanging on her grave, as if she had been a miraculous healer or something. Nevertheless she cannot be so miraculous, since opposite to her prediction, she failed to resurrect in 1993, 100 years after her death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other activity in Pisco is to book a trip to the Ballestas Islands which is also called the Galapagos of the poor man. There are large guano producing bird colonies there and many sea lions. On the way one is also shown a big cactus like drawing on a rock, similar to the Nacza lines. After this boat trip we will go to Nacza and try to book a flight over the real Nacza lines.</description>

The bus ride was very&lt;br /&gt;comfortable. Several films with English subtitles were shown.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the on-board WiFi did not work and I was one number&lt;br /&gt;short of completing the Bingo! in the on-board bingo game.&lt;br /&gt;Now sitting in the Cruz del Sur cafeteria, having breakfast. There is&lt;br /&gt;a TV here, informing us that heavy rainfalls have blocked the Inca&lt;br /&gt;Trail as well as the train line to Machu Picchu. Tourists are being&lt;br /&gt;airlifted to Cusco. We planned to arrive there after visiting the&lt;br /&gt;Nazca lines. Now it's unclear how much sense would it make.&lt;br /&gt;Will try to go to Pisco now.</description>

The main reason for the delay was that it took more than 1 hour to get the Ecuadorian exit stamp. There seemed to be some problem with the computer, the border guard kept checking it, clicking the OK-button on the error message, didn't work, went back to the Discovery Channel that was running on his TV. So several times. I fell asleep in the line, it was 2 o'clock in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the long line of people needing the stamp must have gotten angry and restless, so the border guard decided to fall back to the manual method of recording each person's ID on a piece of paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The busride was horrible too. One had to change to a different bus in Machala (the CIFA bus that takes one across the border stopping at both migration offices). This bus was overbooked. Unlike British Airways the CIFA bus company doesn't pay you 800 euros and book a nice hotel for you in Machala. Fortunately some people got off soon, so in the end I only had to stand for about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 15 o'clock (in 2 hours) going to Lima (15h ride) with Cruz del Sur, which should be a reasonably good company (we alredy took them from Lima to Trujillo). From Lima we go straigth to Pisco. The tourist information in Piura claimed that there are buses every 10 minutes from Lima to Pisco, so should be there tomorrow afternoon. (Btw, the tourist information in Peru is excellent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to take a shower and drink some Pisco Sour.</description>

At 7 o'clock should be there. Haven't decided yet if we go to Huaraz next or rather straight to Pisco.&lt;br /&gt;Spent the last two nights in Cuenca, first in the stylish El Cafecito (which everybody recommends, but which was expensive, 25 USD for dbl with bath, and loud) and then in Hotel Pichincha (11 USD for dbl without bath).&lt;br /&gt;Cuenca is a nice little town with lots of cute cafeterias and many churches. All the museums are closed during the weekend (why?), so there was not much that we could have otherwise done, but luckily Pedro, an old friend from the Zurich days, drove us around showing Cuenca at night (good views from Turi and Baños), and the villages around Cuenca (highlight: the church of Biblián).&lt;br /&gt;Ecuador in general has been great, although we had to cancel some planned mountain climbing and wasted a lot of time doing nothing in Baños. Galapagos was probably the highlight, more about it in another post.</description>

The hike itself was not anything spectacular, as it went along the main road with quite busy traffic. Nevertheless it was quite surprising to see giant tortoises foraging right next to the road. Welcome to Galapagos!! :o) After a short photo break we continued and a few hundred meters further found the tunnel. Such tunnels form when the outside part of the lava flow solidifies fast and the inner part simply flows on, leaving a tunnel behind. Unfortunately the ceiling of the tunnel we visited was collapsing, so we did not go inside. The part that one could see was also quite short (there are much longer ones around Bellavista, stretching even 1 km long), but still it looked quite cool, as I have never seen anything like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S1XYGbVoYVI/AAAAAAAABlE/buxm2ieTjrg/s1600-h/P1160908.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S1XYGbVoYVI/AAAAAAAABlE/buxm2ieTjrg/s320/P1160908.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the afternoon we took a water-taxi to Punta Estrada Beach and walked to an other volcanic formation, called Las Grietas, which is basically a gorge . The interesting thing about it is that it is filled with water coming from two different sources. One is the freshwater and the other is sea water, both filtered through the rocks. The water was very clear and many people were snorkeling, although as the water is filtered through the rocks and is mixed brackwater, I doubt that one can see any animals there. For most of the people the main thing there is cliff diving, as the water is quite deep at certain part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S1XYSQwvHpI/AAAAAAAABlI/b8Xtqjgg5Rw/s1600-h/P1160946.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S1XYSQwvHpI/AAAAAAAABlI/b8Xtqjgg5Rw/s320/P1160946.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today will go on a 4-day trip around the Santiago Island. For the boat and the detailed itinerary see &lt;a href="http://www.galapagos-cruises.ca/yate/nuevoflamingo.htm"&gt;http://www.galapagos-cruises.ca/yate/nuevoflamingo.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The boat will cruise around the island Santiago. We expect to see a lot of birds (most interestingly the magnificent frigate bird which has a big inflatable throat poach, flamingos, Galapagos penguins which are the northernmost living penguins and some more booby species) and lots of marine life during the ample snorkeling opportunities this trip offers.&lt;br /&gt;(This post was originally written on the roof of Hotel Lirio del Mar, but there the wireless didn't support posting into blogger.com for some reason.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The beach had white sand and was extremely flat. So it was reflecting nicely. Other parts of the beach had black lava rocks with thousands of crabs and marine iguanas on them. The crabs can be easily spotted because they are very shy and start clumsily to move (making a lot of noise) when a human gets closer. Many of them are also bright red (Sally Lightfoot crab), I previously thought that crabs get red only if you boil them.&lt;br /&gt;The iguanas move slowly or don't move at all, so often you spot them only when they are 10cm away from you. They are not aggressive though, feeding only on algae.&lt;br /&gt;On the beach we also saw two blue-footed boobies, one of the bird-watching goals on Galapagos.&lt;br /&gt;Later yesterday evening visited the Darwin Research Center where some Galapagos tortoises and land iguanas are kept.&lt;br /&gt;Today will check out the lava tunnels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Nevertheless we have already seen frigatbirds, pelicans, finches, a heron, lizards, crabs, sea lions, and marine iguanas.</description>

Originally hoped to reach Puyo (65km away) but it was getting late and we got worried that we wouldn't make it to the last Puyo-Baños bus (at 6 o'clock). The whole trip took longer than expected because the road contained many uphill parts, although descending some 700m in total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S056HZG7WRI/AAAAAAAAD8E/4SdrUJlDQwU/s1600-h/banos-mera-banos.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5426408868445640978" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_F1zwMvLlhnw/S056HZG7WRI/AAAAAAAAD8E/4SdrUJlDQwU/s400/banos-mera-banos.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 229px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many waterfalls along the first 20km, most impressive being the &lt;i&gt;Pailón del Diablo.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <description>Published by trip20092010 in 2010-01-07T15:05:00.000-08:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2010/01/banos-ecuador.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>Came down to the small town of Baños, located at 1800m in the Andes. The surroundings are amazing, high mountains, very green, but unfortunately since 3 days not really visible, as it is always cloudy and since yesterday it has been raining on and off. Rather on than off... We chose this de-acclimatization because Kaarel felt sick and probably it is not the best option to cure a cold or a flu at 4000m high in the hidden village of Quilotoa with an average temperature of 10C.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Actually I think Kaarel is just faking this sickness because he was too lazy to hike. :o) It is really a pitty, as the landscape was truly amazing. Quilotoa is located on the rim of a crater with a beautiful green-blue crater lake in its perfectly round full caldera. The lake is some 400m lower from the rim and is about 250 m deep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z0qgu90QI/AAAAAAAABQA/TqjAzflUa5s/s1600-h/P1160058.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z0qgu90QI/AAAAAAAABQA/TqjAzflUa5s/s320/P1160058.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water is salty and sulfuric (the vulcano is still active), so it is not potable and has no fish. The weather was not really good and unfortunately we could not see most of the surrounding mountains, including the two most famous vulcanos, the Cotopaxi and the Iliniza. There are several hiking options in the area, but we only hiked down to the lake and back up to the village. Still that hike was pretty awesome, especially when the sun came out from behind the clouds and made the lake change its colors. &lt;br /&gt;The locals in the village were very friendly, they clearly live on tourism, as every second house is a hostel&amp;nbsp; and the rest are "art galleries" or small grocery stores. Still the local women kept their traditional wear of black shoes, white stockings, knee-high dark skirts, blankets around their shoulders and small hats sometimes decorated with peacock feather. Even young girls wear this outfit, but the boys and men do not seem to care that much about tradition and run around in normal clothes. Occasionally some of them do wear a poncho though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z3t7arXGI/AAAAAAAABQY/Nf6j7OULVK8/s1600-h/P1160092.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z3t7arXGI/AAAAAAAABQY/Nf6j7OULVK8/s320/P1160092.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunately we had to leave this Andean paradise and now we are waiting for better weather in Baños, so we can do some downhill mountain biking to Puyo which is 60 km away. The route should be spectacular, passing by many waterfalls in a beautiful valley as it arrives to the steamy jungle. As its name suggests, Baños is also famous for its thermal water. But as it is pretty wet outside, it does not make much sense to visit the spas until the weather gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z1dwmSnsI/AAAAAAAABQQ/sRPvUz3d-CE/s1600-h/P1160202.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/S0Z1dwmSnsI/AAAAAAAABQQ/sRPvUz3d-CE/s320/P1160202.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

There is a crater as well, hope to see some lava bubbling deep in the crater.&lt;br /&gt;In the night the New Year's Eve celebration takes place on the Amazonas street. Here the tradition is to burn life-size (and even bigger) puppets made of cardboard. Many of the puppets depict politicians but also cartoon characters like Batman and Bender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It's 3am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing the border in Aguas Verdes/Huaquillas went smoothly even though Lonely Planet describes this as the worst border crossing in South America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bus from Huaquillas to Quito sucked and took 3h longer than expected, but the views seen from the bus window were interesting: banana plantations, houses on stilts, etc. Unfortunately reached the mountains only in the dark. Quito is 2800m high, the bus gained this elevation in that last 100km.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also cold here, 12 degrees, I think.</description>

Penn State just beat Texas.&lt;br /&gt;The Cruz del Sur bus looked fancy from the outside but the experience was worse than with the Brazilian long-distance buses. We traveled on the lower deck. There was no place for the bags and no room to stretch the legs. Maybe the upper deck is better.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in Trujjillo at 7.40AM. There were plenty of hostels to choose from, we took a one at Plazuela El Recreo (40 soles for a double room).&lt;br /&gt;We are now on our way to Plaze de Armas to visit the tourist information there. Stopped at a nice cafeteria that serves Desayuno Peruano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Saw a bit of the rain forest during take off, and a bit of the Andes half-way through the flight. Otherwise it was cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lima Airport is modern, has helpful English-speaking tourist information and free wireless. Unfortunately they haven't solved the problem of offering convenient and cheap public transport from the airport to the city: upon arrival one is greeted by leech-like taxi drivers who follow you even after you have told them 10 times that 50 soles (17 USD) is too much for a ride to the center. They agree to lower their price to 35 but we are budget travellers and prefer to pay 1.50 soles each for a dala-dala ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next direct bus to Quito seems to be only in a couple of days, but actually it's difficult to conduct a thorough research because there are many bus companies, with bus stations in different parts of the city, their websites suck, and there is no central information service covering all the companies. Exactly like in Brazil ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We picked the bus company Cruz del Sur (had the best website among the 5 companies that the tourist information recommended) and will go to Trujillo in the evening (8h trip). From there we hope to get a bus to the border, and from the border to Quito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trujillo has some pre-Inca mud pyramids and is also close to the beach. So we'll probably spend a couple of days there and try to reach Quito for the New Year's Eve.</description>

In a few hours we should be there. Will then probably immediately take a bus to Quito, Ecuador.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason to take a flight is to be able to experience the Amazonian fractal (?) landscapes from the air. For this reason we took the morning flight. (Peruvian Airlines flies twice a day to Lima, 8.30 and 19.40.) As the sky is very cloudy, we probably won't see anything, however. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iquitos has been a cool place to visit. The highlights were the Belen water city and the manatee orphanage where visitors can feed four manatee babies with milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Published by trip20092010 in 2009-12-23T20:03:00.000-08:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2009/12/downtown-iquitos.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>Arrived in Iquitos at 4pm on a fast boat from Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa is a little Peruvian village across the border from Tabatinga. To get to Santa Rosa we had to take a boat from the Tabatinga port. To get the Peruvian entry stamp the border guard had to be waken up. All this happened in total darkness at 3am in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey in the speed boat reminded a bit flying in an airplane: there was little room to&amp;nbsp;stretch&amp;nbsp;one´s legs and twice food was served. Here they drink Inca Cola and the default coffee here contains even more milk than in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat dashed in 41 km/h on average over the Amazon and in 10 hours we reached Iquitos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iquitos is the largest city in the world with no road connection to the outside world. Our original plan was to continue along the Napo river to Coca,&amp;nbsp;Ecuador. But now it seems (as feared) that this trip would take about 7 days and we can start only Saturday or Monday (unclear, maybe even later). It seems relatively easy to reach Santa Clotilde as there are daily fast boats, but from St. Clotilde to Pantojas (the border town to&amp;nbsp;Ecuador) only slow boats go. We went to see the boat that is expected to leave on Saturaday the earliest and it looked quite scary (small and dirty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other option to continue along the Amazon is to go to Yurimaguas (Peru), 3 days by slow boat, and take a bus from there to Lima (24h). There are boats almost every day it seems, although not before Christmas is over, i.e. Saturday. This way we would postpone the Ecuador trip and travel first in Peru and Bolivia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we could win some time and (maybe) save some money by flying directly from Iquitos to Lima. Flights with Peruvian Airlines are surprisingly cheap, 95 USD one way, and go out every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you, our dear reader, choose: option 1, 2, or 3?</description>

So we'll not be reachable (and cannot reach you) at least until Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday we try to get on a slow boat to Tabatinga which will be difficult because the boats don't really stop in Tefe (because Tefe is not on Solimoes). So it's unclear how this will work out. People here at the Mamiraua office speak English, but they also seem to be confused about how the boats operate here...</description>

Got off the boat after sunrise, at 6AM. Took a taxi to Hostel Manaus, 25 BRL for 2 taxis / 5 people (we were joined by other travelers: a Norvegian, an Egyptian and a French).&lt;br /&gt;Cannot check in before midday, but they have wireless, so just hanging out till then. Maybe get breakfast at some point.&lt;br /&gt;Activities to be done in Manaus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the Teatro Amazonas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy something at the local electronics market (Manaus is the Hong Kong of the Amazonas)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the meeting of the waters, where the black and warm Rio Negro meets the milky coffee and cold Rio Solimoes to form Rio Amazonas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the market building (Mercado Municipal), designed by Jean Eiffel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go on a jungle trip&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Unclear how long we stay here. It depends on the lengths and availabilities of the jungle trips and boats to Tefe, which is our next destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It is located at the delta of the Amazon, therefore a good starting point for boat trips upstream the mighty river. Strange enough it does not seem to be a good day for tourists around here, because strolling on the streets other than the main avenue and the pimped up waterfront area is supposed to be dangerous. At least according to the guide books and the receptionist at the hostel. So we obeyed.... and thus had a relaxing day. Actually there might had been something in those advices because the streets were quite deserted, almost nobody walking around in the side streets and only few people on the main avenue. The waterfront area was however much busier. There is a big building complex which used to be docks (&lt;i&gt;Estacao das Docas&lt;/i&gt;). The architects simply gave it a face lift, so it looks very modern and fancy but preserved the atmosphere of the docks by leaving the &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt; dozen of cranes in front of the building and not disguising its basic iron and glass constructions. Inside there is a theater, a few restaurants, ice cream booths offering exotic Amazonian fruit treats, souvenir shops, travel agencies and alike. This is where we had the first glimpse at he Amazon. It is really huge!!! Although we only saw an island on the other "bank" it seemed to be at least 5 km away. The water was quite rough with big waves and light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally Monday (30.11.) has arrived and we were free to move around in town. So we asked around for the boat tickets to Santarem, our next destination, located 4 days of boat ride away upstreams (it is supposed to have gorgeous white sandy beaches along the turquoise waters of the Tapajos river and untouched primary rain-forest). Finally we bought our tickets at a shabby "office" of Macamazon where people did not speak English. So our Portuguese must be getting better... Later it turned out that we should had been pretty teenage girls to get the tickets 20 reais cheaper, as such girls staying in our hostel got the very same tickets for that lower price. I guess it was not because of me, but rather Kaarel should finally shave and comb his hair... Actually in his swimming pants and flip flops the officers might have thought that he cannot be such a wealthy guy, and maybe the 20 reais discount we have received was due to this... Concerning the boat tickets, the big stories in the guide books about how to get them seem to be quite unrealistic. They suggest e.g. going directly to the docks and talking to the captains. I do not quite see how that would be possible because the docks at the city centre where the boats to Manaus and Santarem should be waiting (again according to the guide books) are fenced off and it did not seem to be allowed just to walk in there. On the other hand our boat will not even depart from these docks but from another one on the other side of the peninsula. So I do not see how one could approach the captain and negotiate with him... &lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, now that we bought the tickets we started the actual sight seeing tour of the city. I would say it is another colonial city, similar to the ones we have visited so far, but in a much better shape. The houses are not that run down, in downtown there are wide avenues besides the narrow cobble stone streets and there are many well-preserved or restored buildings and many well-kept parks. The similarities are the amount of trash on the streets and the smell... Here I have seen the most impressive churches as well, the &lt;i&gt;Catedral de Se&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Basilica de Nossa Senhora de Nazare&lt;/i&gt;. Btw here in Brazil most of the churches have such a long name and most of them are dedicated to some sort of &lt;i&gt;nossa senhora&lt;/i&gt; (our lady of ...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUEB0buUOI/AAAAAAAAA0c/RTwweCLCCcc/s1600/nazare_outside.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUEB0buUOI/AAAAAAAAA0c/RTwweCLCCcc/s400/nazare_outside.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUERoZRW2I/AAAAAAAAA0g/Q0MHJsawykQ/s1600/nazare_inside.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUERoZRW2I/AAAAAAAAA0g/Q0MHJsawykQ/s400/nazare_inside.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said these churches were really worth a visit even though we wrote before that we were getting a bit fed up with the churches. They were very tastefully decorated, not just stuffed full of golden carvings like e.g. in Ouro Preto, which was also impressive but in a way already too much, pretty much just showing off. Particularly the Basilica was a good experience. Not only because of the beauty of the church itself, but also because in front of it in the park there we have seen hundreds of parrots chirping deafeningly loud and flying around in big swarms. I have never seen so many parrots at the same spot!!! and that all in downtown!!! quite weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUDyLVqpII/AAAAAAAAA0Y/9J9ZP_Qqy08/s1600/parrots.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SxUDyLVqpII/AAAAAAAAA0Y/9J9ZP_Qqy08/s400/parrots.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That reminds me of the other weird experience of today. At the port we saw a dead dog on the shore and big black vulture-like birds were picking on it. It was like in a horror movie when one of them picked out the eye-ball....&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Just walked over there. Arrived at the recently renovated Palacio Anchieta (see: &lt;a href="http://www.palacioanchieta.es.gov.br/"&gt;http://www.palacioanchieta.es.gov.br&lt;/a&gt;) around 10:30. The next excursion was about to start at 11.00, but since it was going to be in Portugese anyway, then we immediately were offered a private tour in English (for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The governor of Espirito Santo uses the Palacio as his office but otherwise it seems to be open to the tourists. On Sundays one can even visit the governor's rooms. It's really nicely renovated, e.g. the foundation of the old church that used to be part of the building is shown under the glass floor. A multimedia presentation (also available in English) presents the building's history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then walked aimlessly in the town, trying to find a restaurant but ended up eating "frango with queijo" and drinking Coke at a fast food place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then got an idea to visit one of the beaches (praia de Costa). Getting there on a public bus took about 2 hours.  It doesn't help that we don't speak any Portugese beyond "aqui onibus para o praia?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beach is nice, reminds a bit of Copacabana in Rio. There are no booths where one could exchange into the swimming suit, and the showers to wash of the salt water are very scarce. But the waves are huge and it's fun to jump in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back at the &lt;i&gt;rodoviaria&lt;/i&gt;, using the Internet for 3.50 BRL per hour. Unfortunately they don't allow one to connect one's own laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 18.00 leaving for Salvador. Unclear how comfortable the bus is, or how many stops it makes on the way but the trip lasts 20h. Maybe it would have been better to pay approx. 100 BRL extra and fly there instead.</description>

      <description>Published by trip20092010 in 2009-11-20T02:55:00.001-08:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2009/11/first-full-day-in-rio-de-janeiro.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;Woke up early because we wanted to explore the city as much as possible. But getting anywhere with public transportation is pretty difficult here, because there are only 2 subway lines, which obviously cannot cover the whole city. e.g. it is not possible to take it to the touristy places like the Corcovado (the hill with the Christ statue) or to the Sugar Loaf mountain. So the expensive option is to take a cab or the cheap option is to take buses. Traveling on a tight budget we opted for the latter. &lt;br /&gt;However there are a few problems one faces after such a decision: 1: there are no maps with the bus lines and their stops 2: most of the bus stops are not signed, they are only a shed which kind of looks like a bus stop and often there are several of these close to each other, 3: at these often unsigned stops there are no schedules or even the number of the buses are not marked, 4: rough guide has no information whatsoever about the location of the bus stops either and as there are many one way streets one can only guess on which street one should try to catch a bus, 5: even though the locals are friendly and helpful, they basically do not speak English, but start talking to us in Portuguese, in which situation we can only start nodding and smiling and finish the conversation with an obrigado without having understood anything... so after having explained the situation one will not be surprised that it took us about 4 hours to get up to the the Corcovado with public transportation, particularly, because we walked most of the distance. &lt;br /&gt;The problems were the followings: we could not find the bus stop for bus 584 which was supposed to take us to the cog train station which goes up directly to the hill. So we took the metro to downtown and then a tram. The latter was pretty cool, the tram itself is from the 18th century, kind of like which might run in San Fransisco. It was rattling as much as one can imagine, but the surrounding cobblestoned streets and the houses on them looked very impressive. But, the tram only took us about 1 km further, although on our map the tramline was supposed to go to a middle station of the cog train. So we got off the tram and started walking, hoping that still an other tram will catch up with us. But it did not happen, only buses passed us by, which would also have taken us to our destination, but we only figured that out on the way back. After a few hours of walk with some spectacular views to the city from the hillside and in a secondary Atlantic rainforest of the city's national park, we reached the middle station of the train. Only to find out, that the train always goes directly to the top station without stopping anywhere... great... so we started walking up again. On the way a minivan stopped by us and offered a ride to the top for 15 reais each. We took the offer. We stopped at a view point/ had really cool views to the city and then reached the top station for private vehicles. So we started walking again to the statue. However it turned out pretty soon that the statue would be still at least 40 minutes steep uphill walk away and that there is an entrance fee of 14.20 reais, which was not mentioned in the rough guide. So we started arguing with the people, but they would not let us walk up for free, but insisted that we need to pay and after having paid we could take a minivan up to the statue. So we paid and took the ride. So this was the story of our 4 hour journey to the Christ, the Redeemer. &lt;br /&gt;The statue itself is not as impressive as I thought. It is big, it is true (30 meters) but I thought it was bigger... the view from up there is also pretty cool and we were lucky with the weather, so we could see quite far. The nicest thing was the view to the sugar loaf mountain with the Botafogo beach. Behind the mountain there were a few other smaller rocks in the sea, which also looked cool. The ride back to the city was quite uneventful. We simply walked down to the bus stop, where the tram should be running actually. It was only ca 3 km and the cab drivers wanted to charge us a ridiculous 20 reais. &lt;br /&gt;In downtown we walked around a bit, visited a few churches, among with the metropolitan church was the coolest. In that area a guy wanted to grab my camera out of my hand while I was taking a picture, but it was secured to its bag which was hanging around my body, so he did not get lucky, only I was a bit shocked. Was a similar experience in Zambia when the baboon tried to grab our backpack. Both creatures were pulling pretty hard and both attacks came so unexpected. But we stayed safe, this time did not lose even any biscuits as we did with the baboon.. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

The bus ride was very comfortable, lots of leg room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying at Hostel Newton's Roof-Top, 70 BRL per double room but very bad quality, e.g. compared to Joamar. So tomorrow will probably move again. The staff here is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The afternoon has been rainy, but still walked to the Copacabana beach (made well known by the Singer Vinger song), just a few blocks away. The beach was completely empty. Touched the Atlantic Ocean. The Sugar Loaf mountain was visible although less impressive than expected. Jesus was nowhere to be found. Maybe covered by the clouds or blocked by the skyscrapers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sunset had a &lt;i&gt;peixe frito&lt;/i&gt; at a Chinese place. The hill with Jesus was lit up and Jesus nicely emerged for a couple of seconds from the clouds before disappearing again. Less big than originally expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SwnYhxFCdTI/AAAAAAAAAu8/G_GwW4K2xTw/s1600/jesus_in_the_mist.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JN74r9HqSZM/SwnYhxFCdTI/AAAAAAAAAu8/G_GwW4K2xTw/s320/jesus_in_the_mist.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activities to be done in Rio:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go up to Jesus, and then to the Sugar Loaf mountain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hang out at the beach (Copacabana or Ipanema)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch a football match at Maracana (on Wed a team from Rio plays a&lt;br /&gt;team from Uruguay?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit a &lt;i&gt;favela&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to the center, e.g. the places where the Sambodromo is located&lt;br /&gt;during the Carnaval&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Will stay here 2-3 days before continuing to Ouro Preto.</description>

      <description>Published by trip20092010 in 2009-11-13T11:38:00.001-08:00. <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/2009/11/volunteering-in-london.html">(link to the blog)</a><br/>&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;We originally planned to stay just half a day in London, just to get on the Sao Paulo flight. We have now stayed here for two nights already, and might stay for another night.&lt;br /&gt;On the 11th I arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 5 around 18.45. Cs had been waiting there since 2 o'clock already. Our flight to Sao Paulo, the first flight on our RTW ticket, was scheduled to depart at 21.25. The possibility to drop off luggage had just opened. Turned out, however, that the flight was overbooked by some 20 people. (Quote from the BA information sheet: "Most airlines overbook to make up for people who make a reservation and then do not present themselves for travel.") (There are 247 seats in this aircraft.)&lt;br /&gt;We were offered to take the flight the next day. This is called a "Volunteer scheme". BA offers you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;600 EUR, placed on a Visa Electron in British pounds, to be used up within 3 months (if you lose/destroy the card or forget the PIN then you lose the money);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a night in a hotel close to the airport (including transfer to the hotel and back, dinner, breakfast, and lunch), check-out can be later than 12, e.g. at 17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In return, you agree to take the flight the day after.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a good deal, and there didn't seem to be an alternative anyway. So we took it. I guess it's even an ethical thing to do as we don't really need to be in Sao Paulo on a specific day, while some other people might have to. The BA representative said that the next day the flight is also overbooked, so one can probably "volunteer" again.&lt;br /&gt;Hotel Renaissance is a nice hotel about 15 minutes from Terminal 5 on a Hotel Hoppa bus. We got a twin room, with a bathroom, and TV. Watching the news in the evening revealed that Sao Paulo was without electricity for 5 hours, so maybe it's good to arrive a little later.&lt;br /&gt;On the 12th we spent the day in London. The day felt quite short — it takes 1h30min to go to the center (first by bus to the subway station "Terminals 1,2,3", and then by subway to the center), then 3 hours in Westminister Abbey (one of the places that we didn't visit the last time we where here), then back to make it to lunch at the hotel (closing at 17).&lt;br /&gt;At 18 we took the Hotel Hoppa shuttle to Terminal 5 and went straight to the Volunteer Scheme counter. The flight was overbooked again, as expected. By 36 people this time! So we volunteered again. (Btw, the 2150 pounds received has already covered one of the RTW tickets.)&lt;br /&gt;The accommodation was at the Renaissance again. This time in a double room.&lt;br /&gt;On the 13th, went to London again and spent some time in the British Museum (the Rosetta Stone is there). The last cash we spent on the subway but the BA Visa Electron can be used everywhere to pay for books, food, beer. The Museum was free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;We are the airport now, signed up for volunteering again, and will learn in an hour if there is need for some volunteer work, or if we have to fly tonight.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
