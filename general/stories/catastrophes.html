<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">”Auhtorities have sent a large team
of sixteen aviation safety inspectors to Nazca. This Friday and
Saturday, they inspected all the 48 planes at Nazca and initially
grounded ALL of them. The very first appraisal was that at least two
thirds were not in good conditions. <BR>Today, they declared 7 planes
airworthy and compliant with regulations, and they can fly again. All
other planes remain grounded. The cleared planes are: Aero Diana (1),
Aero Paracas (2), Alas Peruanas (2) and Travel Air (2).”</P>

decided to go down south along the cost to Arequipa and go to Cusco
from there.

sleeping soundly on the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of February, when at 03:34 am
the seventh strongest earthquake ever measured, hit Chile. It was a
huge quake with a magnitude of 8.8. Later we learned that it actually
displaced the whole city of <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">Concepción,
closest to the epicenter by 3 meters to the west and Santiago by 24
centimeters. Quite unbelievable. However, w</SPAN></SPAN>e did not
notice anything as we were about 1500 km away from the epicenter<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">.
In the morning we went to the bus station and bought a ticket to</SPAN></SPAN>
Santiago for the afternoon. After that we heard about the
catastrophe. Next day, arriving to Valparaiso we heard about the
tsunami warning that has been in effect that day.</P>
