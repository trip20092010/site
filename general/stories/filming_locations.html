<h3>Angkor temples, Cambodia</h3>

<h4>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)</h4>

<p>was filmed in Phnom Bakheng, Bayon and Ta Prohm.
See
<a href="http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/l/laracroft.html">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cambodian temple complex, where Croft must retrieve the half of the triangular MacGuffin, is at Siem Reap in Cambodia, where she arrives, with game-style ease, onto Phnom Bakheng, a hill topped by a Hindu temple (though the site later became a Buddhist centre).</p>

<p>She tools up and scoots off in her Land Rover in front of the sacred Bayon temple, in Angkor Thom, its 54 towers, each bearing four enigmatic smiling faces. The most spectacular temple of all, entwined with enormous trees, where Croft encounters the mysterious girl, is Ta Prohm.</p>

<p>The most famous, Angkor Wat itself (the largest religious monument in the world and a World Heritage site), looms over the Cambodian village. It appears to be on a river It’s not. The village was no more than a set built around a small ornamental pond.</p>
