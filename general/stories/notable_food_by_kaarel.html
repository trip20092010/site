<td>7-eleven hot dog</td>
<td>Thailand</td>
<td>If you are hungry and don't feel like wasting time and money
in a restaurant, but want quality food then pick up a 20-Baht hot-dog
from a 7-eleven (the main tourist streets in Banglamphu have at least 10
7-elevens, but there are many also in other parts of Bangkok).
The clerk hands you the bun and the sausage, after which you can add as much sauce
and salad as you wish.</td>

<tr>
<td>Jelly drink</td>
<td>Damnoen Saduak, Thailand</td>
<td>Since having seen it for the first time in Malaysia in 2005
I had always wanted to drink this weird drink containing
large chunks of floating jelly. But as this drink is mostly
sold on the street and therefore based on water of unknown source
I had always postponed trying it. Finally tried it
while visiting the floating markets when Sumpun bought it for us.
Verdict: texture interesting, taste not so much.</td>

<td>Ideal Palace, Chowpatty Beach, Mumbai, India</td>
<td>Indian food is usually so spicy that I've had to throw
it away after a few bites, or ordered Western food instead
or even eaten in McDonald's in the first place.
The dal makhani (a lentil dish) served by Ideal Place
was very tasty and was not spicy at all.</td>
