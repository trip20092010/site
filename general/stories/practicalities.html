<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Insurance.</B></FONT>
The most important thing. However, it is overwhelming how many
companies offer travel insurance in Europe. The problem is that they
are all expensive and there are always 500 rules in their policies,
of course all in the small print that one should read before
purchasing. Of course the advertisement with huge flashing capital
letters offering health coverage up to 5 000 000 British pounds is
always a catch. Usually companies do not pay anything unless the bill
is over 60-100 pounds, so counting on full coverage is an illusion.
Unless one has a severe accident, the health coverage is probably not
used in Africa, South America or most parts of Asia, because the
doctor visits and medication is so cheap. There are also many
inclusion and exclusion criteria of payments e.g. in the case of
kidnapping, terrorist attacks and natural disasters. I read about 20
such policies until I found the most suitable for the most reasonable
price. What is important is that one knows what activities one wants
to do during the holidays. Many insurance policies do not include
diving or mountaineering, bungee jumping, skydiving or white water
rafting. Or they have special criteria: rafting only up to grade 3
rivers, only 3 bungee jumps etc. What is it about the magical number
3? Does it tell a lot about your possible dangerous other activities
if you are planning to do 4 bungee jumps? You are not worth insuring?
Very similar policies from the same insurance company (most companies
sell a British insurance from AXA) are also often sold for different
prices through different travel agencies like Trailfinders and  World
Nomads. So it is worth to compare the prices of different companies.
And what the most important is: always read the small print!</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Round the world (RTW)
plane ticket.</B></FONT> The cheapest way to cover many continents is
this ticket. There are a few airline alliances that offer such
tickets (One World, Star Alliance etc.). The coverage of the alliance
members basically defines which routes are offered. For example
having LAN in the alliance is very useful in South America
(particularly for Easter Island and Tahiti) and Cathay Pacific in
Asia. So having a rough itinerary will define the alliance one has to
take. One thing we could find out was that the price of the very same
ticket differs greatly depending on at which country one buys it (for
One World the cheapest was from UK). However, organizing such a
ticket individually takes a lot of time and nerves. The airline
companies usually do not deal with customers via email. Talking to
the airline companies directly is often a waste of time because most
of the employees have no clue how to put together a ticket like this.
Unfortunately, there are some 100 rules restricting the use of this
ticket (so this is the catch) and not even the airline employees are
familiar with these, often giving conflicting information (sometimes
even stubbornly repeating the false information, just to later admit
they were wrong). Walking spontaneously into the office of an airline
company or trying to get information at the airport ticket sales
office is pointless for this reason. The “best” is when one gives
the wish-itinerary to an employee at these offices and then waits a
few weeks for a reply from a knowledgeable employee to find out
simply that the itinerary is not manageable. Period. No explanation
or any alterations offered to make the itinerary work. There might be
a few travel agencies that claim to specialize in that area and offer
to arrange the flights, but they always charge extra for their
service and some of them might have no actual experience in putting
such a ticket together. Even companies with good reputation can be
disappointing, offering a package for the double price than one could
organize individually. And when one points it out, they ask you to
tell them how you did that... OK, thanks for your help...
Interestingly some companies do not even get back to you after you
exchange a few emails with them...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If money is an issue and time is no
constraint, then my suggestion is to try to arrange the flight
schedule individually. It is a lot of work, takes a loooong time (I
was fighting for 6 months for our ticket) and quite nerve wrecking
though. Although most alliances offered an online booking tool for
such purposes at the time we needed this service (spring 2009) it did
not work properly. One World's tool for example was not able to
process any flight in the Pacific region, so one had to arrange
everything by phone. There was no other choice. There is one phone
number one can call at BA in London and first of all one has to
listen to a several minutes long standard introduction message. Tick
tick tick... you can also almost hear your money going down the
drain... Perhaps it is ok to listen to it once or twice, but not 20
times. And not for 20-30 minutes at a time, as it is how long it
often takes to get trough to BA. And btw the calls are for an
elevated rate...so what does that tell you about customer service?
Whenever I was listening to their “your call is important to us...”
prerecorded text in a gentle voice while I was waiting in the line I
was actually hearing somebody shouting at me: “JUST DO NOT EVER
CALL US”. Politely they also remind you that you can change the
dates, chose your seat, set your menu requests etc. online with their
online booking tool. Guess what? It does not work with the RTW
ticket... 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One more thing about their customer
service: it works in a hierarchical system. You talk to the ignorant
guy first, who usually only thinks he or she knows the rules of the
RTW (of course by any means better than you anyhow, so arguing with
this person is quite frustrating). Then he tells you that he will now
send your request to the pricing department and in about 2 weeks they
will give you a call. Sometimes they do not call back. Sometimes when
you call back after 2 weeks and they tell you that good that you
called because they were about to delete your request, because it has
been so old. Funny people at BA...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of my favorite story was when I was
told several times that they will call back in a <B>few weeks</B>,
when they get an answer from the pricing department, and a couple of
calls later they say that for the pricing department it takes only <B>48
hours</B> and I have to call back, because they will not call me. The
most recent fun call was when we wanted to split our booking, because
the 2 of us wanted to travel individually. One of the ignorant guys
said that splitting the booking will take 5 days, so we have to
decide well ahead. When I called 5 days ahead, the splitting of the
booking was done in 15 minutes on the phone... oh, yes, my favorite
ignorant BA guys...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course this whole cycle of talking
to ignorant BA employees is repeating several times and of course
every time you talk to a different person because the employees do
not give you their direct number, so you always call the central
number and get through to an employee randomly. Even if you remember
the name of the employee you just talked to (to make it simple the
only introduce themselves by their first name) 2 minutes ago (of
course your cheap Skype connection drops often, so you have to start
over again) it is not a big help, because the next employees just ask
you: which Michael?? Ok so lets start all over again... But actually
most often you have to start planning all over again because the
employee at the pricing or whatever department, found it out that
your request itinerary is not possible with this RTW ticket (are you
still wondering why I call the customer service guy the ignorant
one?).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, they can also inform you
about why your itinerary is not possible. A frequent reason is that
you have too many segments on the same continent. Sometimes you just
cannot fly with a given RTW ticket on certain partner airline flights
or on certain routes. With our One World Explorer continent based RTW
ticket it was not possible to get to Auckland from Tahiti. With the
mileage based Global Explorer however, it would had been possible. It
is also interesting that theoretically they do not allow to fly
through the same city twice, but we did fly through Sydney twice.
Once it might have counted as a non-stop over just to catch a
connection though.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So after you waited 2 weeks for the
answer that you have to change your itinerary, you try to come up
with improvised ideas, because our ignorant employee friend is not
really helpful with telling you where you COULD go, only tells you
where you CANNOT go when you come up with a new destination. But of
course this time he is wrong again, so after 2 weeks you again find
out that your itinerary still will not work out. Actually, after
months and months of such fascinating phone conversations with your
new ignorant friend, your itinerary will eventually work out (if you
have not ended up in the loony house yet and still have a few hairs
to tear out) and you get a quote. And then you realize that this
quote is actually higher that advertised on the website. And it is
not because of the  taxes that is not included in the price there,
but because the 10% discount they offer with big flashy letters on
their website does not apply to your order, because you initiated
your purchase 6 months ago!!!! However if you abandon your order that
you were fighting for so hard for so many months and start the
procedure over again you will get the discount!!!! Surprise, surprise
if you do that they are suddenly able to issue your ticket in 24
hours... What the hell is wrong with these people???</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What I still cannot understand is that
why is it not possible to talk directly to the pricing department or
whoever decides about your itinerary and who seem to be aware of the
RTW rules? If they got too many such inquiries I would understand
that these knowledgeable guys would be continuously occupied by these
RTW customers and as their salary is probably higher than that of the
ignorant guys, it would cost the company more. But if they do
actually get many RTW inquiries why cannot they dedicate one guy at
the ignorant level only to this task? Then he would not be ignorant
any more and could save 20 phone calls and a few hours of the
customers life and spare a couple of nerves too and make the
customers satisfied.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Money.</B></FONT>
Nowadays taking an ATM card and a Visa card is enough almost
everywhere. There were ATMs everywhere we have been to, even in
Africa, PNG and Laos, that are infamous for their lack of these
machines. We had no problem picking up money anywhere. There were a
few places where the Maestro card was not accepted, but even there
the Visa or Mastercard was OK. Travelers cheques (TC) are overrated
in my opinion, we actually never needed them. We only used them in
order to get rid of them and that also only on a few occasions,
because there is a surcharge almost everywhere that makes using them
a bad business. I cannot quite understand the reasoning that TC is
good for safety reasons, particularly why it is supposed to be better
than an ATM card. If they get stolen it only means that the money
will not be lost, but it will not solve the problem of being out of
money. If one only carries plastic money the situation is the same,
as blocking the cards is quite easy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, our banks always charged
us for the cash withdrawal from ATMs (more with the Visa and
Mastercard than with the Maestro), but as I have heard there are some
banks that do not do that. So asking it in advance is a good idea. It
is also essential to let your bank know that you will be traveling,
also how long and where to, because otherwise it might happen that
they block the card for security reasons due to unusual activities
(it happened to me when I went to the US for a congress and it was
quite inconvenient). A credit card is a good alternative to pay for
certain things directly particularly to  replace the expensive cash
withdrawals with a Maestro card. Although there is no extra charge
from the issuing banks on credit card payments, it is not widely
accepted in those parts of the world we visited. If it is accepted,
there is usually a surcharge.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Besides cards some cash is also good to
have. Just in case. I think USD is the most widely accepted.</P>
