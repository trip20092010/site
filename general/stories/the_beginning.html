<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beginning</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We wanted to see the world. On TV you
see so many amazing places, cool cities, beautiful nature, inspiring
cultures. I wanted to experience it all first hand. I wanted to be
affected by something new, something different. Most of all though, I
wanted to see the other world, the so called third world, that I have
never seen before. I also wanted to be exposed to poverty, simple,
rural life, to life on 1 USD a day. I wanted to challenge my social
empathy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Western world, as people call it,
is after all quite similarly sophisticated, tending to merge into one
single unit, often mocking each other. Here life is easy,
infrastructure is developed, the language barriers are slowly
vanishing, nothing is so surprising, so awe-inspiringly different, no
experience is life changing. Traveling this part of the world is
easy, can be done when one retires. I wanted something different,
something rougher, something genuine. So we decided to go to places
we probably would not want to go any more (or would not be able to go
to) when we are 65. Probably at that age one does not want to sleep
in hammocks for weeks, let the ass freeze off at 6000 m altitude,
sweat out all body fluids on a jungle trip, be crammed into a 14
seater mininvan as the 20<SUP>th</SUP> person to get from A to B or
even go hiking with heavy camping gears. So we wanted to do this
stuff now, before we get new jobs, before we have to wait an other
15-20 years to be able to get away with or from the kids, before we
would want to spend 100 bucks for a comfortable hotel bed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So how shall we do it? What route shall
we take, which countries? We had only few criteria: the country
should be safe, meaning free of large scale violence and should be
manageable by independent travelers on a low budget. As it turned
out, our other constrain will be British Airways and the whole bunch
of its One World buddies, with their hundreds of rules on the round
the world plane tickets.  Taking their ticket seemed to fit best our
rough travel route, traveling west with the good weather through
Africa, South America, the Pacific area and Asia. It seemed that no
other airline alliance offers this, particularly any trip without
touching North American soil. In the end Africa did not fit into the
BA schedule either, so we had to get separate tickets for this part
of the trip. Talking about roughing it up: it was a real nerve
wrecking experience to try to book the ticket with the ignorant BA
employees in London. I guess to say that it took 6 months, summarizes
the fun enough. During the 410 days abroad and in the so called third
world countries, we never had an experience even close to this. We
got stuck with the London bunch, because the ticket was the cheapest
in Britain. Buying the very same ticket from an other country would
have increased the costs by 500-1500 USD.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So our rough plan was the following:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countries in <B>Africa:</B> the close,
travel catalog-listed countries in the North like Egypt, Morocco were
off our list. So were countries struggling with violence or
disasters, like Sudan and Somalia. What we wanted to do for sure was
to see the African wildlife in their natural habitat (with a special
emphasis on aardvark) and to get a glimpse at the life of the locals.
After some research it seemed that the safest and cheapest way would
be to join an organized overlanding trip in East and South Africa.
Still now it seems that it was the best choice we could have made.
Public transport is close to non existent in many places,
particularly to national parks, so one would need to have a private
vehicle. But renting a car is not really an option if one wants to
cover many countries (not to mention the badly needed mechanics'
skills on the horrible roads in Africa) and hiring a cab is just way
to expensive and the trustworthiness of the driver is always
questionable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>South America: </B>at the beginning
we only knew two things: we want to take a boat trip as far up the
Amazon as possible and hike in Patagonia. Visiting friends was an
extra bonus. Considering that we only planned 3 months for this huge
continent, the obvious route was to do an anti-clockwise round trip 
from Sao Paulo, through the Amazonian jungle to Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Oceania:</B> the only good thing
about the BA ticket was that it allowed us to stop at Easter Island
and French Polynesia. New Zealand and Australia was only meant to be
a transit station. Papua New Guinea has always been an exciting
travel destination that now seemed to be within reach. But there we
again had to buy an additional plane ticket. Fiji sounded fascinating
too, but after many conflicting information and long discussions with
BA that cost a lot of money, because of course calling their customer
service phone number is for an elevated rate, we could not integrate
it to our schedule.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Asia:</B> for several reasons Russia
was out of question, with that a vast part of the continent. Although
India appeared the scariest country of all, that was also the
challenge. Would we be able to cope the huge mass of people, the
extreme amount of poor, the unique culture and food, the infamous
harassment by the locals? We wanted to give it a try.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thailand was always on the list, mostly
because of a good friend living there and not because of the beaches
that we skipped completely. Laos and Cambodia seemed still quite
rural, (and who would not want to see Angkor?) while Vietnam mostly
interested me historically. Indonesia had to be included, so that we
could see the Sumatran orang-utan and possibly rhinos or even tigers
(the expectation was indeed high considering that the Sumatran rhino
and tiger populations are both around 300 and there are as good as no
Javan subspecies left). Of course, meeting face to face with a Komodo
dragon would be also cool. China fascinated us culturally and the
Himalayas attracted us by our goal to go over 7000m above sea level.
Pursuing a nomadic life for a while on the Mongolian plains, riding
horses or camels, living in yurts...hmmm, who does not dream about
that? Japan fascinated Kaarel most of all, because of the high tech
stuff.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the rough plan before we set
out. We did not have much time constrains, other than being eager to
continue our scientific career and the 1 year long validity of our
round the world BA ticket. So we thought we might spend 3 months in
Africa, 3 months in South America, a few weeks in the Pacific region,
1 month in India and China each and a couple of months in the rest of
Asia.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some people ask us if we were not
afraid to travel that far for that long. The answer is no, we were
not. We had basically nothing to lose. We had no jobs, no property,
no responsibilities and no obligations. Well, we also like to think
that we are reasonable adults, not reckless teenagers any more, so we
trusted our abilities to make appropriate decisions to stay on the
safe side. Of course there are a few things one cannot influence,
like traffic accidents, earthquakes, floods and epidemics. But these
things are so unpredictable and  might just as well happen at home
(see bird and swine flu threats, the Icelandic volcano eruption
etc.), so staying at home to avoid these seems the wrong reason not
to go. There were basically only two things that worried me a bit:
mosquitoes and the emotional impact of poverty and sickness. The
former because of the Dengue fever and malaria, the latter because
being helpless is the worst possible situation I can imagine. I would
not have known what to do if I saw a dying poor person or a starving
child. Or even a sick dog... the latter we saw a lot, the former ones
not at all.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Well, this is how our trip begun. We
had two backpacks, a plane ticket and only a rough idea of where we
go and what we do. During the past year you could witness how it
turned out...</P>
