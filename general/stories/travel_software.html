<h1>Travel software</h1>

<p>Mostly a TODO-list/wishlist of travel-related software that would be useful to have or that
would be interesting to implement if traveling didn't take most of the
focus. Let us know if something listed here already exists.</p>

<h2>TODO list</h2>

<h3>GPS data &rarr; movie</h3>

<p>Tool that takes a GPX file as input and as output generates
a Google Earth style movie where the camera flies over all the
locations in the GPX file, in the correct sequence, pausing and zooming
in to places where there is a larger concentration of trackpoints
(or where there is a waypoint). For such locations also human-readable
placenames would be shown. In the corner of the movie, the
timestamp (e.g. "Day 12, afternoon")
that corresponds to the current location is shown.</p>

<p>The duration of the resulting movie
is given as an input argument. The movie could be recorded in real-time
allowing for the simultaneous recording of audio commentary and
mouse pointer movements.</p>

<p>[BUG: maybe already possible with Google Earth?]</p>


<h3>GPS data and border crossings</h3>

<p>Software that takes a list of timestamped long-lat coordinates
as input and outputs a timestamped list of human-readable names
of border crossings that correspond to the GPS data.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/1938/">Software
for analyzing GPS tracklogs to extract human-readable placenames</a>.</p>

<h3>F-Spot - Picasaweb synchronizer</h3>

<p>Program which updates the F-Spot database (<code>photos.db</code>)
and the Picasaweb representation of the photos of the database if a photo
is changed (tags, caption, location etc. edited)
in the database or on Picasaweb. UI example:</p>

<pre>
photo-sync trip20092010 ~/.config/f-spot/photos.db
</pre>

<h3>amr-to-mp3 converter</h3>

<p>... that works under Linux. My Sony-Ericsson cell phone
can record sounds only into the amr-format, which I've only managed
to playback with Quicktime on Mac. ;(</p>

<h3>Waypoint generator</h3>

<p>Given a set of lon/lat-coordinates this program would create a waypoint
for (i.e. in the center of) every larger concentration of coordinates and
map this point to a placename and plot it on Google Maps. This would allow
us to list and visualize all the major towns that we have passed through.</p>

<h3>Customized travel guide generator</h3>

<p>Given a sequence of waypoints generate a PDF- or HTML-file
containing articles (based e.g. on Wikipedia and Wikitravel)
about the towns, natural features etc. whose geographical location corresponds
to one of the waypoints (given a certain
value of proximity). Does Wikipedia or DBPedia provide a webservice
implementing the function <em>&phi;(location, radius) &rarr; set of articles</em>?
Such a program could also allow for the specification of sections
which should not be included in the guide
(e.g. restaurants, hotels above a certain price range).</p>

<p>Motivation: we don't want to carry around a collection of out-of-date lonely planets
which among useful things discuss also locations which we do not intend to visit,
hotels/restaurants which are too expensive, etc.</p>


<h3>Visa requirements</h3>

<p>Program whose input is the names of two countries C1 and C2 and whose
output is TRUE if citizens of C1 require a visa to enter C2 as a tourist,
FALSE otherwise. Each country should be required to make sure that
the data behind this service is up-to-date.</p>

<p>Such a service would enable an automatic generation of pages
such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Estonian_citizens">Wikipedia:
Visa requirements for Estonian citizens</a>,
and ranking countries by how mutual is their visa policy.</p>


<h3>GPS and News</h3>

<p>Given a sequence of timestamped lon/lat coordinates (like in a GPX file), map this
sequence to a corresponding sequence of (links to) news stories, where each story
describes an event which happened in a given time and place.
This would help to discover events which happened while we where there, but which we missed
for some reason.</p>

<p>Is this possible with http://news.google.com?</p>


<h3>GPS and Weather</h3>

<p>Same as with news, but the coordinates and timestamp pair would be
mapped to a description (and not a prediction!) of the weather at that place at that time. As we
do not record the weather data during the trip, this
would later help to answer questions like: where did we experience the heaviest
rainfall, highest temperature, strongest wind, etc?</p>


<h3>Most viewed photos on Picasaweb</h3>

<p>Program to list the most viewed photos on trip20092010 Picasaweb.</p>

<p>Strangely, the number of views does not seem to be available using the Picasa Web Albums Data API.
See also
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-picasa-data-api/browse_thread/thread/3cf0af88a155c575">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe doable via Google Analytics?</p>


<h3>Picasaweb and GPS data</h3>

<p>Add EXIF lat/lon values to all the photos on the trip20092010 Picasaweb, based
on the GPS data.</p>

<p>Needed: Picasaweb API + software for aligning photo timestamps with GPX timestamps.</p>


<h3>Picasaweb and longest beards</h3>

<p>Program to find all the photos of a given person, and sort them in the order
of the length of the person's beard on the picture. This would give a useful insight into
the dynamics of the beard length (which is changing all the time during the trip).</p>

<p>Needed: Picasaweb API + Google face detection software (probably not
exposed yet through the Picasaweb API?) + (yet to be implemented?) beard length
detection API.</p>


<h3>YouTube spellchecker</h3>

<p>Program to spellcheck all the video captions on trip20092010 YouTube.</p>


<h3>YouTube and GPS data</h3>

<p>Add lat/lon coordinates and timestamps to all the videos on the trip20092010 YouTube,
based on the GPS data.</p>

<p>The movie file that our camera creates does not seem to contain any timestamps,
but this information is available in a separate JPEG-file created together
with each movie. The timestamps in these files could be aligned with the timestamps
in the GPX-files to obtain the geo-coordinates. The YouTube API could then be used to
update the properties of the uploaded videos.</p>


<h3>Antipode finder</h3>

<p>Out of all the GPS tracklogs find a pair of lon/lat points that are "most opposite"
to each other. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes">Wikipedia: Antipodes</a>.</p>


<h3>Furthest inhabited places</h3>

<p>Program that finds the furthest inhabited place from a given place (e.g. Tallinn).
Is there a webservice (e.g. SPARQL query over DBPedia, or a query over Freebase)
that does this?</p>


<h2>DONE list</h2>

<h3>Flag service: URLs for countries' flags' images</h3>

<p>Reported to the Google Charts API team that the flags for Papua New Guinea
and Macau are missing, see
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-chart-api/browse_thread/thread/0bcaaa69f6f03217#">the report</a>.</p>

<h3>Search blog posts by location</h3>

<p>Implement a Google Map (or a KML file)
with the locations of all our blogposts marked
on it and linked to the content of these posts.</p>

<p>Implementation is based on Blogger Export format, XSLT,
and KML. See <a href="../../tools/atom_to_kml.xslt">atom_to_kml.xslt</a>.</p>


<h3>Most viewed videos on YouTube</h3>

<p>Program that lists the most viewed videos on YouTube, that have been
uploaded by a given list of users (e.g. trip20092010, nairobicapetown).
YouTube's own display of the most viewed ranking seems to suck.</p>

<h3>Picasaweb spellchecker</h3>

<p>Program to spellcheck all the photo captions on trip20092010 Picasaweb.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple Python program using the
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/overview.html">Picasa Web Albums Data API</a>
to fetch all the captions.</li>
<li>Using `aspell check' to automatically detect and manually fix the captions.</li>
<li>Another Python program to replace all the captions with the changed captions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Result: 52 captions fixed in 32 albums.</p>

<p>Note that in mid 2010 Picasaweb started supporting the editing of all the
album's captions on a single page. In this way the built-in spellchecking support
of Firefox can be used to search for spelling mistakes and fix them.
This solution is somewhat more convenient to use than the one described above.</p>
