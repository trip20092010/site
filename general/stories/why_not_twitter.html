<h1>Five reasons why Twitter is not good for posting trip notes</h1>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
We used Twitter for posting short messages from Africa, see: <a href="http://twitter.com/nairobicapetown">http://twitter.com/nairobicapetown</a>. Due to some limitations of this solution we have decided to switch the platform.
These limitations are:
<ol>
<li>It is possible to post via SMS, but only one phone number is supported. We would like to post from at least 2 phones.</li>
<li>Posting via email is not possible, i.e. one cannot use SMS→email→blog either.</li>
<li>Stupid 140-character limitation. Why isn't it 160 that is the max length of an SMS?</li>
<li>There is no straight-forward way for others to comment on the posts, unless one signs up with Twitter and uses the @-notation.</li>
<li>Doesn't always work, e.g. didn't work (in a stable way) from a Kenyan number. (To be fair, maybe this was a problem with Zain.)</li>
</ol>
So we have decided to switch to Blogger, i.e. subscribe to <a href="http://trip20092010.blogspot.com/">http://trip20092010.blogspot.com</a>.</div>
