<div class="wip">Work in progress!</div>
<p>[BUG: add possibility to sort by dt, is there a jQuery plug-in for that?]</p>

<dl>
<dt>island</dt>
<dd>Triangle-shaped island, with the three corners marked by volcano craters.
Only one of the corners is easily accessible to tourists.</dd>

<dt>airport</dt>
<dd>The runway is so long relative to the size of the island
that it almost cuts one of the corners off the island. The airport receives
one LAN flight per day [BUG: check], either coming from Santiago on the way to Tahiti,
or the other way around. </dd>

<dt>Hanga Roa</dt>
<dd>The only town on the island.</dd>

<dt>expensive</dt>
<dd>Rapa Nui is relatively expensive compared to the rest of Chile.
E.g. 5000 CLP for camping per person, 10,000 CLP for pasta bolognese in a restaurant.
However, in the end we spent approximately the same amount of money than in Peru and Bolivia
because slept in tent, walked a lot, and never ate out.</dd>

<dt>moai</dt>
<dd>Large human statues carved from volcanic stone ([BUG: pumice, porous scoria?]).
The moais are found on many
places on the island, mostly badly damaged and pushed face-down.
Some have been restored and placed onto an ahu.</dd>

<dt>ahu</dt>
<dd>Ceremonial platform that hosts the moai-statues.
It is not allowed to go behind the ahu (in most of the places, but there are exceptions),
because the crematorium is there. Neither the moais nor the ahus
are protected from rain/wind (due to a regulation by UNESCO?).</dd>

<dt>Orongo</dt>
<dd>Ceremonial village on the top of a cliff (300m from the sea level),
reconstructed in 1976. Home of the civilization after the moai-builders.
Center of the Make Make cult which replaced the moai-cult in the 16th century.
Houses built of stone slabs have tiny doors and no windows.</dd>

<dt>birdman competition</dt>
<dd>Tangata-manu (birdman) competition was an annual ritual where chiefs of
different tribes of the island competed in who can swim from Orongo
to the Motu Nui islet and first come back with the egg of the seabird Manutara
(Sooty Tern, <em>Sterna fuscata</em>). The winner became the new birdman.
The last competition was held in 1867.</dd>

<dt>Rano Kau crater</dt>
<dd>Crater in one of the corners of the island.
The crater lake is covered with totora reed making it look a bit
like a swamp. Some of the original Rapa Nui plants still live in
the crater being protected from the ocean and the human activity.</dd>

<dt>(stray) dogs</dt>
<dd>Dogs are hanging around everywhere in Hanga Roa, begging for food
and chasing the wheels of the cars.</dd>

<dt>black lava rock</dt>
<dd>On the coast</dd>

<dt>waves</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>horses</dt>
<dd>Most frequently seen mammal</dd>

<dt>cows</dt>
<dd>Also frequent</dd>

<dt>eucalyptus trees</dt>
<dd>Rapa Nui is otherwise bare, but there are occasional patches of eucalyptus forests.</dd>

<dt>museum</dt>
<dd>[BUG: add]</dd>

<dt>lava tunnels</dt>
<dd>Tunnels that are formed during the lave flow when the surface of the flow
cools down while the inner flow still continues. The biggest one is Ana Te Pahu, that
was used by the people for living, storage of food and water, plantation [BUG: confirm].</dd>

<dt>topknot</dt>
<dd>"Hat" for the moai. Made of red volcanic stone found in Puna Pau.</dd>

<dt>Puna Pua</dt>
<dd>Red volcanic stone quarry, topknot factory.
From here the topknots where rolled to the ahus, e.g. as far as Anakena.</dd>

<dt>church</dt>
<dd>Catholic church; service in Spanish but songs in Rapa Nui;
church full of people: Sun 9am</dd>

<dt>Rapa Nui men</dt>
<dd>Like to wear with long hair and flower shirts</dd>

<dt>Rapa Nui women</dt>
<dd>Like to wear flowers in their hair</dd>

<dt>Rano Raraku</dt>
<dd>Volcano crater and the (main) moai "factory", the highlight of Rapa Nui.
Most of the moais are outside of the crater positioned in various ways
on the hillside. Some are half-finished. The tourist trail passes the moais
closely.
Some of the moais are also in the crater by the small crater lake.
This site is mostly off-limits for the tourists.
The park ranger didn't know why the moais ended up in the crater.
Maybe the scientists are still exploring it (there was a group
working in the crater).</dd>

<dt>15 moais</dt>
<dd>Statues of 15 moais at Tongariki.
Popular sunrise destination. The statues were re-erected in 1993 (?).
In 1960 (?) (when they were still vertical on the ground) a tsunami hit
the coast and washed them 100 meters inland. A local ranger didn't appreciate
this site saying that re-erecting the statues was a one man vanity project
and the statues were harmed during the works.</dd>

<dt>Anakena</dt>
<dd>Sandy beach, expensive tuna sandwiches, and a few moais.</dd>

<dt>football</dt>
<dd>The most popular sport on Rapa Nui with
at least 4 teams and many spectators.</dd>

<dt>circular plantations</dt>
<dd>[BUG: add: Manavai]</dd>

<dt>mana</dt>
<dd>[BUG: add]</dd>

<dt>petroglyphs</dt>
<dd>Many rock carvings are found in Orongo, Tongariki and Papa Vaka.
Images include: tuna fish, whale, fishing hook, shark, boat, turtle.
Not covered
so unprotected from wind and rain. Who knows how long they will
last like this.</dd>

<dt>gas station</dt>
<dd>Only one gas station on the island.
Offers: diesel (500 CLP) and 93 (600 CLP).</dd>

<dt>Hanga Roa cemetery</dt>
<dd>Mostly Crosses, but one birdman statue could be spotted as well.</dd>

<dt>Spanish</dt>
<dd>Everybody speaks Spanish, but the local language
is also occasionally heard.</dd>

<dt>surfers</dt>
<dd>Can be seen in Hanga Roa.</dd>

<dt>tourists</dt>
<dd>Few tourists in April, seemed to be off-season.</dd>

<dt>car rental</dt>
<dd>For 24h one can rent a 4x4 jeep for 25k&ndash;30k CLP.
This allows to explore the further parts of the island e.g. Anakena
and Tongariki.
Other options are: bike, scooter (requires motorcycle license), quad-bike.</dd>

<dt>Entel</dt>
<dd>The only cell network available on Rapa Nui.</dd>

<dt>garbage</dt>
<dd>It is difficult to dispose garbage on Rapa Nui. E.g. in Orongo there are no garbage cans
and one is required to take his/her garbage back to Hanga Roa.</dd>
