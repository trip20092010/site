<h1>Surprises in Oceania</h1>

<p>The following is a list of things that surprised Kaarel in Oceania.</p>

<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-08</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Rano Kau crater lake</h3>
<div class="image">

</div>
<p>I had seen various things in the bottom of a crater before (lake, village, safari park)
but the bottom of the Rano Kau crater looked like a swamp. Later it turned
out that there is not a swamp but a lake covered with <em>totora</em> reed (the same reed used in
the Uros islands on Lake Titicaca). Some of the original flora of Rapa Nui still
survives in the bottom, protected from the ocean and the humans.</p>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Waves</h3>

<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-12</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>French Polynesian money</h3>

<img src="../images/P1240933.JPG" title="French Polynesian money"/>
</div>
<p>The money used in French Polynesia (French Pacific Franc, CFP) looks like
toy money &mdash; large paper bills and aluminium? coins (their lightness
reminds chocolate coins).</p>

<p>(This was the first impression when seeing the 5 CFP coins,
later it turned out that the
larger coins (e.g. 50 CFP and 100 CFP) are actually quite nice.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-14</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Clarity of the water</h3>
<p>An hour or so before the sunset tried to kayak from the south-western
cost of Parea (Huahine island)
to the reef (where the waves were breaking) but it proved to be
too far away. At some point the ink blue water became almost transparent
so that one could clearly see the white sand bottom of the lagoon at least 3 meters deep
in some places.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-15</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Feeding the eels</h3>
<p>In Faaie there is a little river loaded with eels.
(An eel is a snake-like fish with surprisingly slimy body.)
A local policeman (?) encourages you to buy a can of mackerel
from the kiosk and feed it to the eels. This attracts the attention
of three local kids and one dog who all want your mackerel, the dog wants to
eat it, the kids want to feed it to the eels.</p>

<p>The eels are very tame, sticking their heads out of the water and eating
almost from your palm.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Crabs crossing the road</h3>
<p>Almost ran over one of them on a scooter. (Most of them
are very attentive and shy though, spotting you already from the distance
and running away.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-16</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Flying fish</h3>
<p>Entering the Bora Bora lagoon on the King Tamatoa ferry, saw a fish (a needle fish?)
perform at least 10 consecutive jumps (in attempt to get out of the ship's way?)
which looked like flying. Didn't know that fish can jump like this...</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-22</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Rapper</h3>
<p>A guy making sounds with his voice and the microphone [BUG: what's the correct term],
downtown Auckland.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="day">
<h2>2010-04-23</h2>
<div class="surprise">

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Sensitive plant</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1250109.JPG" title="Mimosa pudica"/>
</div>
<p>In the winter garden next to the Auckland Museum came across the
<em>Mimosa pudica</em> plant that folds its leaves when touched.
Don't know when/if it would open them again.</p>
