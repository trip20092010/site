<h1>Tahiti notes</h1>

<div class="wip">Work in progress!</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before entering French Polynesia I knew very little about this place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paul Gauguin lived and worked in Tahiti</li>
<li>France tested nuclear weapons in Mururoa, one of the atolls</li>
<li>In the film "Sneakers", the character played by Sydney Poitier wanted to
go on vacation to Bora Bora with his wife.</li>
<li>The people of Tahiti like to eat French baguette</li>
</ul>

<p>We also listened to a Amateur Traveler podcast about
French Polynesia [BUG: link] before and learned that:
hiking to the highest point of Tahiti (approx. 2000m) is doable in one day;
French Polynesia is very expensive but there is a campsite on Moorea
(which can get full during the weekend when all the French expats go there);
the food is cheapest (and good) at the Papeete Market.</p>


<h2>Day 1, Mon, 2010-04-12</h2>

<p>Arrived to the Faaa airport around midnight, found a flyer at the airport
that pointed out Pension Fifi, just a few hundred meters from the airport.
Stayed the first night there in a dorm. The most expensive accommodation that
we have had so far: 55 USD for two persons in a dorm. The room was clean,
there is water purification machine that provides unlimited
drinking water, large showers, small breakfast (French baguette with jam/butter
and coffee).</p>

<p>Over coffee put together the following TODO list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit Papeete market (cheap food)</li>
<li>Visit pearl market (?)</li>
<li>Gauguin museum</li>
<li>Black pearl museum</li>
<li>Bora Bora</li>
<li>See an atoll (e.g. Mururoa)</li>
<li>Moorea (close to Tahiti; frequent ferry connection; cheap accommodation, i.e. camping)</li>
<li>Snorkeling</li>
<li>Buy ticket to NZ
or maybe find a package tour to New Zealand, if cheaper</li>
<li>E-register for Australia</li>
<li>Whale and dolphin watching (if season)</li>
<li>Submarine ride on Bora Bora</li>
<li>Climb Mount Orohena (2241m) either in one day, or if possible then spend the night on the top</li>
<li>Rent a tent</li>
<li>Visit a pearl farm</li>
</ul>

<p>Took a public bus to Papeete (100 CFP pp), visited the tourist information
and various travel agencies. The tourist information was not that helpful
or competent, but they had free fruits there. Talking to the travel agencies
it became clear that the cheapest way to reach New Zealand (this is where
our RTW ticket continues from) is to fly with Air Tahiti Nui for 76000 CFP.
This is a round-trip ticket as one way would be more expensive.</p>

<p>Had lunch at the market. I ate a Chinese dish with beans, maccaroni, rice,
pork, and one kind of vegetable.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many fat people</li>
<li>Homeless people have very long toe nails</li>
<li>Many women wear flowers in their hair</li>
<li>Drivers respect the pedestrians and stop if they see one
by the crossing</li>
<li>People are helpful, many speak English</li>
<li>Many people wear tattoos.</li>
<li>Almost every woman wears pearls (the Tahitian Cultured Black Pearls).</li>
<li>It's probably not possible to find an accommodation that is cheaper
than the dorm in Faaa.</li>
</ul>

<p>Took a bus back to Faaa around 8. The bus stops are not marked and one had
no idea what the schedule is. The taxi drivers tried to convince us
that it would better to take a taxi (1500 CFP, but after 8 o'clock the prices would
get higher). We didn't give up hope (the tourist information had told us that
the buses to the airport run until 8 or so) and finally the bus came (200 CFP pp).</p>
