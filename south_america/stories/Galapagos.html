<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Galapagos Islands</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A place, everybody knows and dreams of
to see... We did too. However realizing this dream is quite
expensive, therefore we were thinking about it for a long time
whether we should do it now. Considering that we had no real
Christmas gifts, we thought this would be a good way to make up for
it, so we did it. It also has to be added that we got a pretty good
last minute offer... In total we spent 7 days on the Islands, 3 on
our own in Puerto Ayora, on Santa Cruz Island and 4 days on a cruise.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We started our trip from Guayaquil,
Ecuador's largest city. All the flights to Galapagos go through
Guayaquil, even the ones starting from Quito, the capital. We took an
early morning flight at 8, but strangely we had to be at the airport
2 hours before departure, as if it had been a long distance
international flight, not a domestic one. It turned out that getting
to the Islands is not that easy, but the regulation of entry are
almost as strict as to Australia. First you have to get your bags
checked with the National Park, so they can disinfect them or
something by radiation. Then you have to pay 10 USD as some sort of a
tax of entry, and you get a nice plastic INGALA Migration Card. Only
after all this may you check in.</P>

	on Santa Cruz</I></FONT></P>
</SPAN>Unfortunately, the sky was cloudy so we did not see much from
the air, although the view of the islands must had been impressive.
We only saw Baltra, a small island to the north of the main inhabited
island Santa Cruz, where the airport is located (there is an other
one on San Cristobal). Baltra was used as a military base during the
Second World War, and due to the human activity hardly any native
animals remained, including the land iguanas. The latter were
reintroduced, so there is now a small population of about 100
animals. The landscape surprised me quite much, because it was very
dry with little vegetation. As it turned out this is not a rare view
on the islands. Interestingly, the amount of precipitation varies
greatly between the islands, but also within one island. On Santa
Cruz, for example the middle area which are called the Highlands
(highest point is 826m) are very green with lush vegetation. On the
other hand, the coastal areas are quite dry. It is quite similar to
the mainland area of South America, where on the cost there is desert
due to the cold Humboldt current, but in the mountains it is quite
rainy. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So we arrived and lined up for quite a
long time at the immigration, even our carry-on-bags where checked
again. No idea why it was necessary, because it is still part of
Ecuador. Is it simply because otherwise if they only make you pay the
100 USD National Park fee, it might appear that they are not doing
anything else but collecting money? Anyhow, the amount of money the
NP is collecting must make a little fortune, considering that every
day there are two incoming flights to Baltra, each of them flying in
ca. 100 tourists. Where does it all go to?! Interestingly at the
airport the tourist information did not even speak English...</P>

</SPAN>After we were through with the bureaucracy, we got a free
shuttle bus ride to a ferry which shipped us over through a narrow
channel to Santa Cruz Island. There we took a bus to Puerto Ayora,
the largest town on the archipelago. There was no tourist information
in town, which is quite weird considering that this is THE tourist
attraction in Ecuador... Later it turned out that there was an
office... about 3 km out of town, in an area where there was nothing
and therefore hardly any tourist would pass by... We did pass by, but
only by accident when we were looking for some lava tunnels and we
were glad we did, because it was there, next to the main road where
we saw our first giant tortoises!! They were just grazing around, so
casually... So cool!!

</SPAN>The most amazing place close to town is Tortuga Bay. It is a
mostly sandy beach, located about 45 minute walk away from town.
There is a prepared road, made of small rocks, so it is not possible
to get lost and it is not possible to leave the path either because
there are huge, seemingly impenetrable cactus forests along the way.
They also make the walk quite interesting, because on some of them
there are bird nests, some of them are rotting away, leaving only a
strange fiber structure behind and some of them are real giants.
Between them one can spot lava lizards quite frequently.

the joy of the first spotting is soon overtaken by the overwhelming
sight of hundreds of these animals laying around in each others close
proximity on the rocky beach a few hundred meters further away. They
are really amazing  creatures, with their dragon-like appearance and
large spikes along their spine. As they are not afraid of humans, one
can observe them from very close, as some of the huge males are
threatening each other by vigorous head nodding and even fighting
each other, while the smaller and darker females do not let
themselves be bothered by the show the males put up. Nevertheless,
when one gets really close they start sneezing as a kind of a warning
(normally they do that on a regular basis anyhow, because this is how
they get rid of the salt in their body) and only if one almost steps
on them,  do they run away.  It might actually happen because the
almost black females are very well camouflaged on the black lava
rocks.

interesting thing on that stretch of beach are the very clear
reflections on the wet sand. Taking funny pictures here compensates
for the lack of swimming possibility (the currents are too
dangerous). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Further away in a small bay it is
possible to swim, or rather just to cool down in the water, because
it is way too shallow for a real swim.  But on the shore a few
blue-footed boobies, magnificent frigatebirds and a few Darwin
finches can be observed.</P>

</SPAN>An other attraction is just 10 minute walk away from town: the
headquarter of the Charles Darwin research station which does all the
scientific work on the Islands. Their info booth is not very
interesting, but here one can visit the breeding station of the giant
tortoises and even walk into their enclosures. There are also many
baby tortoises visible. The aim of this project is to maintain and to
increase the population of the several different giant tortoise
species which decreased due to human influence. On one Island (Pinta)
for example the indigenous tortoise species has only one single
survivor: a male called Lonesome George.

</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT>Because no other individual of the same species
exists, the scientists decided to try to pair him with females of an
other closely relates species, which lives on a neighboring island.
However, so far they could not produce viable offspring. It is an
other question whether such breeding program really makes sense,
because the result would only be an artificial hybrid and whether
further severe inbreeding is really healthy??? The research station
has a breeding program for land iguanas as well, but one can only see
3 or 4 of these animals in different enclosures. They give a strange 
impression with their yellow colors.

</SPAN>In the town itself there is not much to do. It is very
touristy, full of souvenir shops, travel agencies and restaurants.
One may hang out at the port to watch wildlife and in the evening to
watch humanlife, as this is the time point when the town gets a bit
more active. At the port there is free wireless as well and during
the day there are sometimes volleyball games at the entrance to the
port. Close to town there are a few short lava tunnels as well, but
tourists do not go there often, because during their visits to the
highlands in their tour package they are shown much bigger and longer
ones. These are basically volcanic caves, which were created after an
eruption, when the hot lava kept on flowing under the already cooled
down surface.

</SPAN>On our last free afternoon we  wanted to visit a volcanic
gorge that is filled with both salt and fresh water. Interestingly
the different waters do not mix here, but the saltwater that is
filtered through the rocks from the sea remains on the bottom and the
freshwater (originating from creeks and rain) stays on the top. To
get there we took a boat to the other side of the bay in the port of
Puerto Ayora and walked for half an hour through a dry landscape with
cacti and bushes. We passed by an area where the locals are producing
salt from the seawater by making it evaporate in a shallow pond. The
gorge was quite spectacular with the highlight being the local guys
jumping into the water from the top of the rocks.

</SPAN>On our forth day we started our organized tour with the boat
Flamingo. It is probably one of the smallest tourist boats and can
only take 8 people.  As the whole boat itself, the rooms were also
very claustrophobic, with a bunk bed for 2 people and a small
bathroom. Other boats have up to a few hundred tourists. The boat
traffic is very strictly regulated. It is only possible to visit the
Islands with licensed boats which all get their route determined by
the National Park. They set the rules when the tourists may get to
the shore and who may accompany them (only the tour guide usually,
the rest of the crew may only enter land at very few areas). As there
are only a few sites where tourists may get to shore, sometimes the
boats literally line up at these areas and wait until they may enter
the island. Between each landing there must be at least a 20 minutes
time difference and it is also regulated how close the different
groups may approach each other. On the Islands there are prepared
trails one has to follow and it is not allowed to touch or disturb
the animals. If a company breaks these rules, it means that their
lose their license. Furthermore, it may have consequences for the
whole tourist industry. We were told that for example in the Turtle
Cove a guide once captured a turtle to show it to the tourists and
the authorities found out about it. Because of this incidence they
banned snorkeling at this site, even though it must be an amazing
place since the turtles come here to mate and sharks and rays use the
area as a kindergarten for the offspring.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Our tour covered a relatively short
sailing around the Rabida, Bartolome, Santiago and Santa Cruz
Islands. We started with a bus trip to the Highlands of Santa Cruz,
which is basically the center area. It is the main farming area on
Galapagos, where one sees many cows grazing. The main attraction here
is the giant tortoises which are grazing along the cows. The farmers
have to build their fences in a way that the tortoises can cross
underneath them, so their movements would not be limited. We visited
such a private farm and could observe many tortoises. It was really
fascinating to walk around and spot such a giant creature munching on
grass in almost every bush. Surprisingly they were very shy, unlike
the other wild animals we have encountered on the island and pulled
back their heads into their shells quickly when we approached them
and gave a loud hissing sound.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the visit we drove back to Puerto
Ayora, got back on the boat and sailed during the night to Rabida
Island. It is a very small island, famous for its red sand that has
its color from its iron content. Mostly sea lions inhabit the island.
They used to occupy only the sandy beaches and flamingos used to wade
in a small salty lake close to the beach. However, since the
authorities cut a path into the bushes which separate the lake and
the beach from each other, the sea lions found a new playground and
invaded the lake. The sea lions used these waters as a toilet which
stunk to the flamingos (the amount of the algae and crabs the
flamingos feed on in the lake decreased), so they abandoned the lake.
Here we walked around among the sea lions who did not show interest
in us whatsoever and did not move at all when we approached them. The
babies however were very curious and approached us so much that we
had to move out of their way. They were sooo cute and one would have
wanted just to hug them and play with them. But of course this cannot
be done, not only because of the rules of the authorities, but also
because they would be abandoned by the mother if she can smell the
human touch (so were we told). On the shore we found many sea stars
that were probably taken out of the sea by the sea lions who like to
play with them. Otherwise the island itself was not that interesting,
the landscape was similar to the one on the coastal areas of Santa
Cruz: many cacti, leafless trees, dry land. There are no large
breeding colonies of birds here, either. The water on the other hand
was full of colorful fish and it was fun to snorkel.

the western coast of Santiago Island, that was just a few hours away
by boat. Here one may walk along the coast and snorkel on the beach.
For people who did not go to Tortuga Bay, this is the first encounter
with black lava rocks and marine iguanas and the colorful crabs. We
saw a few fishing birds and sea lions as well. Because of the
presence of the latter, snorkeling was a bit stressful, because there
was a huge dominant male on the beach. An encounter with him in the
water may end up quite nasty and it would not be him who would get
hurt.</P>

</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT>On the third day we reached Bartolome Island,
located at the eastern side of Santiago Island. This is the place
where most of the postcard pictures are taken of its two bays and the
pinnacle rock. The island is really small and the tourists may walk
on prepared boardwalks only. It consist of a cone of an extinct
volcano and many secondary craters, through which gas and lava
erupted many many years ago. Hardly anything grows here other than a
few lava cacti, but the rocks have many colors, ranging from red to
yellow.

</SPAN>The highlight again was the snorkeling. We took a small boat
to the opposite side of the island where the big boat was anchored
and snorkeled back all the way. It took us 1.5 hours and we saw lots
of animals!! Sometimes Galapagos penguins darted by, sometimes
white-tipped reef sharks circled around us (at one point we counted
14 of them!!), at other times sea lions were swimming with us,
blowing bubbles around us... We even saw a huge ray!! It was really
amazing!!! However our next snorkeling in Sullivan Bay just across
from Bartolome on Santiago Island was just as amazing. Besides these
animals, we spotted several sea turtles and could follow them for
quite a long time, observing their graceful flight through the
waters... They come to this Bay to lay their eggs and we saw their
traces on the beach in the sand, so probably there were quite a few
nests there.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sandy area was quite small though,
because after a recent eruption a lot of black lava covered up the
coast. It left very weird formations behind and it was quite fun to
walk on it and look for interesting shapes. This lava field was
created after an eruption 125 years ago, so Darwin, who was exactly
in this Bay some 180 years ago, saw a completely different landscape.</P>

</SPAN><BR CLEAR=LEFT>On our last day we visited the Black Turtle
Cove, on the northern part of Santa Cruz Island, close to the
airport. It is covered with mangrove that provides an ideal spot for
sea turtles to mate and for shark and ray babies to grow up. So what
we saw was mating sea turtles and shark and ray babies swimming
around. This was a very memorable ending of our tour. A few hours
later we were sitting on the plane back to Guayaquil...

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To sum up, we had a great time on the
Galapagos Islands. We encountered the unique wildlife, had a lot of
surprises and amazing experiences, particularly during snorkeling. We
chose a boat trip that covered a relatively small area and was, most
of all  about snorkeling. I think it was a great choice in January, 
because most of the large bird colonies that I would have wanted to
see are deserted in this season e.g. that of the albatrosses and are
located on the further Islands.</P>
