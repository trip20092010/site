<H3>Pantanal</H3>
<P>We took a 4 day trip to Pantanal from Campo Grande with the budget
tour operator Ecological Expeditions. They had a very good reputation
and were highly recommended by both Rough Guide and Lonely Planet and
are almost the only tour operator that fit our low budget who operate
from Campo Grande. They have their own campsite along the only road
that goes into the Pantanal from the south. We were taken there by a
minivan together with an Australian and an Israeli couple and an
Italian guy. The drive was 5-6 hours long, along which we did not see
many settlements. We had to change cars when we reached the dirt road
that leads into the Pantanal. Basically all the lodges are located
along the road as this is the only dry area. Along the  road there
are fences because the whole Pantanal is private land used for
farming, and the cattle is probably the second most commonly seen
animal after the mosquito. There are tons and tons of mosquitoes
there that are DEET-resistant, so one cannot escape them. The good
news is that they are not as dangerous as in Africa or in the the
cities, as there is no malaria or Dengue fever there. Although our
sleeping facilities had mosquito nets around them, these had holes,
so at night we got bitten. Bitten, many may times... We could not put
on long sleeved clothes either, because it was quite hot even at 
night. So we could chose what should not let us sleep, the heat or
the mosquitoes. A further insomniac factor was the hammock we slept
in.  Strangely, after almost a full month of sleeping in hammocks on
the Amazonian boats, now I just could not get a rest. In spite of
these inconveniences, we decided to stay an extra night, mainly
because I was fascinated by the wildlife. Being a city freak, Kaarel
would have preferred to go to Sao Paulo, but actually it did not take
too long to convince him to stay a bit longer. Could it be that he is
turning into a wildlife fan?</P>
<P>Our guide was Sandro, who – by surprise – spoke very good
English and knew a lot about animals. To me the most impressive skill
is that of an ornithologist, who can tell in a second what species
that small, gray sparrow-like bird is that just whooshed through the
air 50 meters above you. And Sandro could do that. So we were in good
hands. On the first day we arrived late to the camp, so we did not do
anything that evening, but committed ourselves to the rice and beans
and spaghetti dinner and I have tried to prepare myself physically
and psychologically that this is going to be my lunch and dinner
while there. And it was.... only the breakfast brought some variety
with bread and jam.</P>
<P>On the second day we had a full day of safari. We set out by car
and drove deeper into the Pantanal. The drive was adventurous, as we
were sitting on the roof of a truck and had to duck every few seconds
to avoid the branches chopping off our heads. But the view was much
better from up there and there was a lot to see. The landscape was
very impressive, with the flooded land all around and with the
bushes, flowers and the cloud-dotted blue sky that was reflected in
the smooth water surface. To maintain the natural flow of the water, 
there were bridges almost every kilometer. These were the places
where we had a better view to the water and the caimans swimming
around in it. As our trip took place at the end of the rainy season,
there was not much land left dry, so it was not a good time to see
terrestrial mammals, like jaguars. Sandro claimed that these animals
migrate to the north this time of the year. I have not heard of that,
so I was a bit disappointed to find out, that exactly at the spot
where one's chances are the highest to see a jaguar in the wild, we
probably will not see one...  Luckily, the amount of other animals we
saw, mainly that of birds, compensated somewhat for this. I was very
much impressed by the huge Jabiru stork, the symbol of the Pantanal,
that I have never seen before. It resembles a marabu stork with its
bold head, size and body structure, but has a weired, swollen
rubber-like naked black and bright red neck that looks like a stuffed
stocking. 
</P>
<P>Being a mammal fan, for me the highlight of the animal spotting
was the six-banded armadillo, we discovered in the bushes. We found
an other one digging for insects, but we only saw the earth flying
out of its burrow and a bit of the tail and unfortunately did not
wait for him to come out after it filled its belly... An other cool
thing to see was the capybara, the largest rodent in the world. We
watched them sunbathing, swimming, grazing, even saw a family with
babies. To Kaarel's disappointment, they were not eaten up by
caimans... It was not less exciting to watch coatis running around on
the trees above us, making funny noises  (not less impressed by these
creatures, now Kaarel wants a pet coati...) or to follow a bush deer
for a few hundred meters as it was grazing, apparently not disturbed
by the fact that 10 people were chasing him with cameras. Once in a
while we saw a few dark shadows move around in the tree canopy; black
howler monkeys. The light colored females usually disappeared quite
quickly, only the black male was left behind, inspecting us
suspiciously. At such occasions it was difficult to decide who is
watching whom.  At other occasions we spotted beautiful bright
colored hyacinth macaws or a group of toucans with their enormous
orange bills. These animals we spotted during our walking safaris
when we stopped with the truck on the road and climbed over a fence.
These areas were mostly forested, often only by palm trees, not good
for any kind of human use. As everywhere, we met a lot of cows during
these walks and encountered the cruelty of this wet environment by
the many cattle skeletons scattered around everywhere. It is indeed
quite a harsh way to raise cattle, as there is not much grass, but
only bushes and swamp- and water-plants and nobody seems to look
after the farm animals. They just put the young bulls there on the
farms and let them grow. The unfriendly conditions are clearly
visible on these bulls, as they are more like skeletons themselves
than slaughter-ready fearsome meat masses.  During one of our car
safaris we saw how a long river of these skeletons were herded out of
the Panatnal for fattening in other areas by the gauchos, the local
cowboys. As our sophisticated European breeds would not survive these
conditions, they keep a more resistant Indian cattle breed. 
</P>
<P>On one of the walking trips we actually went into the water. We
walked for ca. half an hour barefoot in thigh-high water. With every
kind of plants twisting around our feet and caimans and piranhas
lurking around every bush in front of my imaginative eyes, I found
myself in one of my nightmares. I could not even clutch onto Kaarel,
as I usually do in such situations and endure his jokes about
pinching me under water faking a caiman or piranha attack, as during
that walk he was fishing for piranhas with an other group. 
</P>
<P>Catching these reputable predators is the top attraction for many
people who come to the Pantanal. Nevertheless only a few dare to go
as far as trying to take out the hook from their mouth themselves and
actually their meat is not that good, unless fried hard, because it
is full of bones. The fun is that it is not  a boring kind of fishing
when one sits for hours and waits for the catch, but soon after one
lowers the bait into the water the piranhas grab it and so one can
catch many in a short time. However, one still has to pick the right
spot, where there are many piranhas and not like Kaarel's unlucky
group who did not catch anything. Of course it was not their idea to
go fishing at the river right next to the camp, but it was the fact
that forced them to stay there that one of the two cars we could use
in the camp got stuck in the mud and the other one took my group out
for the walking safari. Interestingly it never occurred to anybody
that a 4 wheel drive might be useful to transport the visitors in the
mud-covered Pantanal or alternatively that the road could be fixed,
so that the trucks won't get stuck every single day. Interestingly,
these incidents only happened at varying parts of the ca 300 m long
road within the campsite and not on the main road. Perhaps there was
a weired enjoyment of the  camp staff in these daily mud wrestlings
that prevented them undertaking any action. We could not quite share
this kind of enjoyment in getting stuck in the mud, because it either
meant that our activity got canceled, like our dawn spot-light
safari, or was less fun, like the piranha-less piranha fishing or it
meant that we had to walk back to the camp in the mud in flip
flops... It has to be added though, that on our last day the horse
riding was probably only added to the activities because there was no
vehicle to take us out of the camp. Luckily the horses were very
calm, actually quite lazy, so I was not too worried about the
possible  consequences of Kaarel's lack of riding abilities. He could
even stay in the saddle while we were galloping and seemed to enjoy
it that much that he said it was the highlight of our Pantanal visit
for him.</P>
