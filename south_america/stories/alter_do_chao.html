<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Alter do Chao</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Alter do Chao is
located an hour bus ride away from Santarem. We booked a 2 days trip
to the primary rain forest located on the eastern bank of the Tapajos
river. The trip started at 8.30 am which is actually quite late for
jungle trekking. From Alter do Chao, the village we spent the night,
we had to take a boat upstream on the river. The ride was quite bumpy
because of the waves and took 1.5 h. We arrived to a small riverside
community with 90 families. After arrival we looked around in the
village, visited the local bars – there were 2 of them, both had a
pool table, which seems to be obligatory in all the communities –
the small school, the community house where they hold meetings, the
manioc processing hut, and the football field (every small village
must have one). The houses seemed to be in a good shape, scattered
far away from each other and with animals running around them, e.g.
pigs, chicken, ducks. That village even had electricity and most of
the houses had satellite dishes in order to receive lots of TV
channels. We were told that there is a huge soap opera cult in Brazil
and the theory goes that this is why the birth rate has decreased
dramatically over the past few years... Indeed in the house of the
village chief the TV seemed to be running all the time we were around
and most of the family members were watching it. It has to be added
however that it was a weekend as well, when people tend to have more
time for such activity.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the afternoon we
went for a bit of paddling on a small creek which ran into the
Tapajos river. The landscape was very impressive, with bright green
grass on the banks and semi-dry trees. The water was the clearest I
have ever seen before with all the water plants visible and with many
many fish one might see in aquariums in Europe. I just loved that
area. During paddling we have spotted jacanas running up  and down
along the bank, and a few other birds including kingfishers and an
eagle. It was very easy to see the fish in that transparent water and
so we have seen 10-15 species including piranhas. They were
relatively small and harmless as we were told, so at the end of the
boat ride we even went swimming and snorkeling. It was a very cool
experience!!! 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">When we finished
with snorkeling, we paddled closer to the Tapajos, which was
separated by a big sand dune from the small creek and started walking
back to the village on that sandy beach. The next surprise was the
6000 years old pieces of pottery scattered all over on the beach.
These are the oldest signs of human civilization in the whole Latin
America. And we were just walking among them!!! Those pieces were
really everywhere. Our guide told us that archeology is underfunded
in Brazil, so the scientists have no money to collect them. Weird. In
Europe such a site would be closed down from the public and would be
buzzing with archaeologists... On the beach we also found colored
clay in yellow and red which was used back then to paint the pottery.
Quite strangely, this whole beach is flooded during the wet season –
when by the way one might see <I>peixe boi</I> (manatee) in these
waters – so why all these pieces of pottery are not washed away is
a mystery to me...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Next we jumped into
our motorboat and drove downstream to a neighboring community where
most of the people live on latex production. This area used to be a
rubber plantation a few decades ago and now they are tapping the
remaining trees to produce rubber. They are also making a few
articles for sale, e.g. bags, hats, sandals, pen holders and rubber
animals (similar to the rubber ducks used in the bath tubs...). In
the village we were shown the process of latex making and visited the
small shop. We bought a rubber manatee (what else?!) and a small
rubber frog as an amulet. This frog is the symbol of good luck in
this region and is depicted on the pavement and in the parks in the
towns we visited. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">After a sunset
cruise we returned to our home community where we had dinner and
slept on the beach in hammocks. We were sitting at a  bonfire and
sipped caipirinha before going to bed. A relaxing way to end the day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Next morning we had
a jungle hike which was supposed to take 6 hours. The community we
visited is located in a protected area, the Floresta Nacional do
Tapajos. There are few hiking trials which one can visited with a
guide. The guides all come from the communities in the park and are
trained by the EMBA, the organization which is responsible for the
National Parks and Reserves. This is also a way how locals make a
living – besides the latex production they live on tourism.

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 0.19in; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
The hike was pretty cool, the first half was in secondary forest and
we passed by plantations as well. The second half was in primary
forest with quite a few huge trees. The end point of the hike was a
600 years old gigantic tree. We felt like small ants standing next to
it. It needs 25 people to hug its trunk!!! It was very impressive!!!
Along the way our guide explained us a lot about the trees we have
passed and their possible usage e.g. eatable fruits, leaves to cover
the roof of the houses, resins to make boats waterproof and which
part of which tree is good as medicine.  He was really knowledgeable
and told us that their community learned all these things from the
indigenous population which lived there before them and which does
not exist any more. Nevertheless their genes survive partially,
because the colonizers produced offspring with them, so the current
inhabitants are their descendants. About the jungle: it is really as
it is described in the books. Many trees, impressive flora but very
little visible of the abundant fauna. One only sees the small
animals, which I found just as interesting as the big mammals. The
funniest thing was the swarms of caterpillars on tree trunks. They
aggregate for the sake of protection and form fuzzy spots on the
trees. Touching them is not advisable  as they burn the skin with
their secrets. An other cool creature was a huge grasshopper ca. 20
cm long!!! We also saw huge butterflies, some of them had camouflage
colors but some of them were shiny blue. These latter ones one can be
seen often in insect collections of museums and here they were just
flattering around everywhere. There were also many many ants, most of
them marching in a line across or along our path. Some of them were
ca 1.5 cm long and had huge scissor-like mouth-pieces. These are used
by the locals to stitch wounds, just like in Africa. At the end of
the hike we also saw silver tamarins (small white monkeys with a
black tail) jumping around on the trees. So at the end it was a very
enjoyable trekking. As we stopped so many times along the way to
listen to the guides' explanation, the hike took us 8 hours.
Eventually we got back to Alter do Chao around 8 pm, a few hours
later than planned, but for that we had a beautiful boat ride back
with the setting sun and a few river dolphins jumping around our
boat.</P>
