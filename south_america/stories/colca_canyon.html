<div class="wip">Work in progress!</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>5h drive from Arequipa.</p>
<p>Second deepest canyon in the world (the trips do not go the deepest place though).</p>
<p>Condors nest in the canyon.</p>

<h2>Pre-trip</h2>

<p>Booked the trip with <a href="http://peruandesexpedition.com">Peru Andes Expedition</a>.

with them.</p>

<p>Best time: 1h 43min (French guy who was listening to Prodigy to boost himself up).</p>
<p>Worst time: 2h 20min (chain-smoking Italian Matteo).</p>

<p>After reaching the top one of the Irish musicians realized that he had left
his money-belt down at the Oasis.
Sandro called the owners, they went looking for it (it was supposed to be under
the pillow) but could not find it. The Irishman went back down. Sandro followed
him. In the end they went down 2/3 of the way, there they met the owner who came
to meet them with the belt that he had finally found.</p>

<p>Walked to Cabanaconde and had breakfast there. Then waited a couple of hours
for the Irishman and Sandro to come back.</p>

<p>Bus trip back. Stopped at a viewpoint to take a better look at the terraces.
Stopped in Maca. The nice colonial church there was closed. Took a picture with
a llama and an eagle.</p>

<p>Spent an hour at thermal baths close to Chivay.</p>

<p>Stopped briefly at Mirador de los Andes, Patapampa, the highest point
during the trip, approx. 4900m. Very cold.</p>

<p>Stopped briefly to chase some llamas/alpacas.</p>

<p>Drove by a small group of vicuñas.</p>

<p>The trip ended at the Plaza de Armas in Arequipa where the van dropped us off.</p>
