<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mamiraua Sustainable Development
Reserve</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Reserve (12 400 square km) is
located about an hour boat ride away from Tefe, around the Rio
Japura. Together with a neighboring Reserve Amana (no tourist
facilities here) and the National Park Jau, it forms the largest
protected area in the Brazilian rain forest.  The unique thing about
Mamiraua is that it protects a flooded forest, meaning that when the
snow melts in the Andes there is hardly any dry land here, so all the
terrestrial animals have to survive on the trees and have to be good
swimmers. Therefore there are not so many mammalian species here as
in the usual rain forest. E.g. pecary or armadillo cannot survive
here, but on the other hand it is a paradise for fish and the birds
feeding on them, as well as for aquatic mammals, like the pink
dolphin.  It also means that the trees had to adopt to being under
water for half a year.  It is very difficult for their seedlings to
survive and therefore the bottom levels of the forest are quite
sparse (almost like in a European forest). After the flooding is
gone, in the dry season it is possible to walk around and the animals
can move down to the ground as well. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An other interesting thing about the
Reserve is that it became protected following a researcher's studies
here, who was observing the white uakari monkey (undoubtedly the
ugliest monkey there is). He found out that this monkey only lives in
this very confounded area and thus its whole home range has been
declared protected and the monkey itself as an endangered species.
How this researcher has managed to achieve that might be an
interesting story.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So this is the area where we decided to
undertake our jungle experience. We have spent 4 nights in the only
lodge of the Reserve located on its edge. There is no other way of
visiting the reserve. The area that the tourists may visit is
restricted to a mere 35 square km.  But even after 4 days there it
did not seem too small, as we visited different parts of it. We
arrived in the dry-to-wet transition period, so we could do both
walks and boat tours. In the flooded period only the latter is
possible. Because of the high amount of fish, there were many many
fish-eating animals around, including birds (egrets, herons,
cormorants, kingfishers etc.), caimans, and predator fish (including
the largest fresh water fish, the <I>pirarucu</I> which can grow up
to 200 kg) and of course the dolphins, both the grey and the pink
river dolphins. The oxygen level of the water is quite low,
particularly during the hot dry season when the rotting plant
material also consumes quite a lot.  Therefore the fish have
developed different oxygen capturing methods. The <I>pirarucu</I> for
example has to surface in every few minutes (with a huge splashing
usually) and swallow air from which the oxygen is absorbed in its
bladder. Other fish have similar organs or have tentacles around
their mouth which acts as an additional oxygen filter.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The program at the lodge included
jungle hikes on prepared paths, canoing, motor boat excursion,
spotlighting at night on foot and from the boat and a presentation of
a research project which is currently running in the reserve . There
are around 50 different projects to chose from and we listened to one
about the <I>boto – </I>the pink river dolphin.  The wildlife
viewing was a great experience, not only because we saw much more
animals than I expected (including a sloth and coaties and all 5
resident  monkey species), but also because our guide Pedro was a
biologist with a huge amount knowledge about the animals. His English
was excellent and he was a good spotter as well, just like the local
guides who came with us to every trip. These guides could not really
communicate with us, because they only spoke Portuguese, but they
always carried books with the pictures of the animals with them and
when we saw something they pointed to these pictures.  For me the
highlights were the paddling on the river with canoes and the search
for animals in the canopy. The night boat ride was also quite a lot
of fun. There is really a huge number of caimans in the rivers!!! 
Every 10-15 meters we saw the red reflection of their eyes in the
spotlight. There were pretty huge ones amongst them, so there was no
question any more why swimming is not recommended, only in the small
cage-like pool at the lodge.  Around the lodge itself there are a few
resident caimans as well which are usually relaxing under the
floating buildings. They seemed to be attracted by any noise one made
in the water, so swimming and splashing around would definitively be
a bad idea around there...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jungle in this flooded forest is
not that one might have in mind as a real jungle. There is actually
quite a lot of light in it and the vegetation is not that dense, the
trees are not that huge either. Probably this is why spotting the
animals is easier than in the <I>terra firme</I> (dry land) forest
which is the “typical jungle” (it also explains why we have not
seen any larger animals in Alter do Chao which is a <I>terra firme</I>
area). There are many trees with huge roots above the ground both for
support and to capture air.  In this environment it also makes sense
to rely on fish to spread the seeds of the trees, therefore many
trees have fruits in the flooded season. Similar to the typical
jungle, there are also many lians and epiphyt plants (sitting on the
trees like orchids and bromelias). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the name of the Reserve suggests,
the main emphasis is on the sustainable development of this area.
There are quite a few regulations which limit the exploitation of the
natural resources and many projects focus on increasing the income of
the local communities from alternative sources instead of agriculture
(which leads to deforestation) and fishing and hunting. For example
most of the employees of the lodge (some 60 people) come from the
local villages, living in the Reserve and many research projects also
hire locals. From the lodge visits are organized to the  villages
(the guide there also receives payment) during which the locals can
sell some handicraft. Some of the produce from the villages is also
used by the lodge and the researchers.  There are many research
projects which investigate the impact of the Reserve on the life of
the locals and on the environment. The one I could read the summary
of concludes that since the establishment of the reserve the young
locals use less manioc... Interesting... 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyhow, it was a great experience to
see a sustainable project working in harmony with nature and with the
locals, as there are only very few of its kind in the Brazilian rain
forest.  The lodge itself is an ecolodge, in its real sense, not just
on the ads and thus has a very little impact on the environment. They
use solar energy, clean their waste, separate garbage, collect the
rain water etc... So it is highly recommended for eco-conscious
visitors.</P>
