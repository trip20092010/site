<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First full day in Rio de Janeiro.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Woke up early because we wanted to 
explore the city as much as possible. But getting anywhere with
public transportation is pretty difficult here, because there are
only 2 subway lines, which obviously cannot cover the whole city.
e.g. it is not possible to take it to the touristy places like the
Corcovado (the hill with the Christ statue) or to the Sugar Loaf
mountain. So the expensive option is to take a cab or the cheap
option is to take buses. Traveling on a tight budget we opted for the
latter. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However there are a few problems one
faces after such a decision: 1: there are no maps with the bus lines
and their stops 2: most of the bus stops are not signed, they are
only a shed which kind of looks like a bus stop and often there are
several of these close to each other, 3: at these often unsigned
stops there are no schedules or even the number of the buses are not
marked, 4: rough guide has no information whatsoever about the
location of the bus stops either and as there are many one way
streets one can only guess on which street one should try to catch a
bus, 5: even though the locals are friendly and helpful, they
basically do not speak English, but start talking to us in
Portuguese, in which situation we can only start nodding and smiling
and finish the conversation with an <I>obrigado</I> without having
understood anything... so after having explained the situation one
will not be surprised that it took us about 4 hours to get up to the
the Corcovado with public transportation, particularly, because we
walked most of the distance. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problems were the followings: we
could not find the bus stop for bus 584 which was supposed to take us
to the cog train station which goes up directly to the hill. So we
took the metro to downtown and then a tram. The latter was pretty
cool, the tram itself is from the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century, kind of
like which might run in San Fransisco. It was rattling as much as one
can imagine, but the surrounding cobblestoned streets and the houses
on them looked very impressive. But, the tram only took us about 1 km
further, although on our map the tramline was supposed to go to a
middle station of the cog train. So we got off the tram and started
walking, hoping that still an other tram will catch up with us. But
it did not happen, only buses passed us by, which would also have
taken us to our destination, but we only figured that out on the way
back. After a few hours of walk with some spectacular views to the
city from the hillside and in a secondary Atlantic rainforest of the
city's national park, we reached the middle station of the train.
Only to find out, that the train always goes directly to the top
station without stopping anywhere... great... so we started walking
up again. On the way a minivan stopped by us and offered a ride to
the top for 15 reais each. We took the offer. We stopped at a view
point/ had really cool views to the city and then reached the top
station for private vehicles. So we started walking again to the
statue. However it turned out pretty soon that the statue would be
still at least 40 minutes steep uphill walk away and that there is an
entrance fee of 14.20 reais, which was not mentioned in the rough
guide. So we started arguing with the people, but they would not let
us walk up for free, but insisted that we need to pay and after
having paid we could take a minivan up to the statue.  So we paid and
took the ride. So this was the story of our 4 hour journey to the
Christ, the Redeemer.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The statue itself is not as impressive
as I thought. It is big, it is true (30 meters) but I thought it was
bigger... the view from up there is also pretty cool and we were
lucky with the weather, so we could see quite far.  The nicest thing
was the view to the sugar loaf mountain with the Botafogo beach. 
Behind the mountain there were a few other smaller rocks in the sea,
which also looked cool.  The ride back to the city was quite
uneventful. We simply walked down to the bus stop, where the tram
should be running actually. It was only ca 3 km and the cab drivers
wanted to charge us a ridiculous 20 reais.   
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In downtown we walked around a bit,
visited a few churches, among with the metropolitan church was the
coolest. In that area a guy wanted to grab my camera out of my hand
while I was taking a picture, but it was secured to its bag which was
hanging around my body, so he did not get lucky, only I was a bit
shocked. Was a similar experience in Zambia when the baboon tried to
grab our backpack. Both creatures were pulling pretty hard and both
attacks came so unexpected. But we stayed safe, this time did not
lose even any biscuits as we did with the baboon...
