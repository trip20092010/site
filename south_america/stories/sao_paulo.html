<h1>Two days in São Paulo</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Instructions on how to spend two days (Saturday and Sunday) in São Paulo.</p>

<p>In the following,
the locations are shown in boldface, and the costs (for 2 people in BRL) in green.</p>

<h2>Day 1 (Saturday)</h2>

<p>Land at the <b>Guarulhos airport</b> one hour later than estimated.
Immigration, baggage claim and customs go very smoothly.
Fetch 600 BRL with your Visa Electron.
You have to try several ATM machines (e.g. Banco do Brasil), until Bradesco finally works.
Bradesco has a daily limit of 600 BRL which is more than enough for two people for two days
in São Paulo.</p>

<p>Take a local bus from the airport to <b>metro station Tatuapé</b> (<span class="cost">7.50</span>)
and from there a metro to
<b>Praça da Republica</b> (<span class="cost">5.10</span>).</p>

<p><b>Hotel Joamar</b> (<span class="cost">140</span> for 2 nights in a double room)
where you will spend the next two nights is just two blocks
away from the metro station. It's a nice and clean hotel. The room has a TV,
an AC, and a shower. Breakfast is included. But there is no wireless and
your laptop's powercabel does not fit into the electricity sockets.</p>

<p>After a short nap in the hotel and a brief visit to <b>a tourist information
office</b> close to the hotel explore the center of São Paulo.
Notable places are
<b>Edifi'cio Altino Arantes</b> (a copy of NYC's Empire State Building),
<b>Pa'tio do Colégio</b> (the site of the oldest Jesuit mission building in Brazil?),
<b>Praça da Sé</b> and its <b>Catedral Metropolitana</b>. Go into the cathedral
and look for the tropical details (coffee beans and crocodiles) in the doorway
carvings (as the Rough Guides suggests).</p>

<p>It's hot, buy a 1.5l bottle of water (<span class="cost">2.50</span>) and walk on
to <b>Liberdade</b>, the Japanese/Asian part of the city. (In the early 20th century, about 200,000
Japanese came to São Paulo to work in the coffee plantations. Now, São Paulo hosts
the largest number of Japanese living outside of Japan.)
There are several <b>food stalls</b>. Approach one of them and say <em>Posso ter uma rouhlade primavera?</em>
and receive a spring roll (<span class="cost">2.50</span>).</p>

<p>Walk back in the direction of your hotel. The evening seems to have
started (it's about 4 o'clock), as the <b>eating/drinking places</b> start to
get crowded. There are many musicians playing in the bars. Beer is served in bottles
wrapped in something thermos-like.
People pour the beer into small glasses before drinking it.</p>

<p>Visit the <b>41th floor viewing platform of Edifi'cio Ita'lia</b> (<span class="cost">30</span>).
Edifi'cio Ita'lia is one of the tallest buildings in São Paulo and offers an impressive
view to the city and the <b>Edifi'cio Copan</b> next to it. All you see is
skyscrapers. The view to the larger green areas, e.g. the Ibirapuera park that you plan
to visit tomorrow is blocked by the tall buildings. The Copan building is
a curvy skyscraper designed by the famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, who
was also behind the design of the buildings in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.</p>

<p>Now spend some time trying to buy an adapter in order to be able to
charge your laptop at the hotel. Try at <b>a home appliances store</b>, but
they don't have any. They are helpful though, and point you to another
store (for photo equipment?). This store however seems to be far away and
is probably closed for today already. (Of course, it would not be open tomorrow (Sunday)
either.)</p>

<p>Have dinner at <b>a fast food place</b>:
beirutes (?) with frango (chicken sandwich),
pasteis queijo (cheese pie),
fruit juice,
600ml Brahma beer
(<span class="cost">20</span>).</p>

<p>Finally, buy a 1.5l bottle of water (<span class="cost">1.60</span>)
and go to the hotel to sleep.</p>


<h2>Day 2 (Sunday)</h2>

<p>It has been raining all night, and the rain continues in the morning
while you walk to the <b>Mosteiro São Bento</b>
for the 10 o'clock mass to listen to the
Benedictine monks singing Gregorian chants.
The program consists of [BUG: write based on the handout], but you get
bored after an hour, sometime in the middle of the program.
The performance is free but a donation is expected (<span class="cost">0.5</span>).</p>

<p>Next you venture a little further away from the center, to <b>Mercado Municipal</b>,
a big market building with stained-glass windows.
Talk to a <em>bacalhau</em> seller who has been living in New Jersey for a while.
(He is the 4th person that you have met so far in São Paulo who can speak English.)
<!-- Add something about fruit and fish sold on the market. -->
There are several places in the market building that offer food (e.g. <em>pastel de bacalhau</em>)
but you decide to have lunch later and only get a fruit salad (<span class="cost">3</span>).</p>

<p>Next walk to the <b>Estação de Luz</b>, explore briefly
the <b>Parque da Luz</b> next to it, and take the train to <b>[BUG: where]</b>
(<span class="cost">5.10</span>). Next walk downhill towards the
<b>Parque do Ibirapuera</b>. It is about 2km away and has no metro stations closer
than the one that you arrived at. Ibirapuera has a few geocaches which you
have previously stored into your GPS device. Set the GPS arrow to point to one of them and follow
the arrow. You pass by lots of skyscrapers, that get prettier the closer to the
park you get.</p>

<p>The park is now visible but surrounded by roads
with heavy traffic. It is unclear how to best enter the park. Fortunately you meet
a jogger whose English is fluent so that for a second
you mistake him for an American.
He is a local guy who lives close to the park and likes to come jogging here.
He knows the best way to the park. At the entrance you depart from him.</p>

<p>Have lunch at <b>restaurant The Green</b>. The restaurant has a buffet
where you pay for the weight you eat, regardless of what you eat,
e.g. if you are bigger and eat meat you spend <span class="cost">15</span>,
and if you are smaller and a vegetarian you spend <span class="cost">10</span>.</p>

<p>The park has several ponds. From the bridges you can watch how
fish, swans, and ducks fight with each other over food.
Attempt some geocaching but give up as the areas around the caches are very
crowded.</p>

<p>Next visit the <b>Monumento as Bandeiras</b> at the edge of the park, and climb
on it discussing with yourself if climbing on a statue is really an appropriate thing to do.
Many other tourists are doing it though.</p>

<p>Then locate <b>a bus stop</b> asking help from the locals. Take
the bus to the <b>Avenida Paulista</b> (<span class="cost">5.10</span>).</p>

<p>Walk along the wide avenue stopping only to buy
a bowl of sweetcorn (<span class="cost">2</span>).
When reaching the <b>Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP)</b> inspect this weird building
but do not go inside. Instead cross the street and enter 
<b>Parque Siqueira Campos</b>, 45,000 square meters of <em>Mata Atlantica</em>.</p>

<p>Walk back to the hotel through <b>Bixiga (Bela Vista)</b>,
the historical Italian district where small colorful houses
stand next to skyscrapers.</p>

<p>Finally buy 2 500ml-bottles of water (<span class="cost">4</span>)
and go to the hotel to sleep.</p>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>São Paulo is a huge city. In two (jetlagged) days one can get some overview 
of the center. The highlight is definitely the view from the top
of Edifi'cio Ita'lia.</p>
