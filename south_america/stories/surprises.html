<h1>Surprises in South America</h1>

<p>The following is a list of things that surprised Kaarel in 
South America.</p>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Guarulhos Airport</h3>
<p>Going through the immigration, baggage claim, customs, tourist
information, to the bus stop,
and then by bus to the closest metro station (Tatuapé) was one of the
fastest and smoothest "leaving of the airport" that I've ever experienced,
completely contrary to what Rough Guides and some travel podcasts claim.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>View from the 41st floor of Edifício Itália</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1120725.JPG" title="Buildings as far as eyes can see."/>
</div>
<p>Edifício Itália used to be the tallest building in São Paulo.
(Unclear, what holds the record now.) For 15 BRL one can walk outside of the
41st floor restaurant and view the city from every direction.
The view from the Empire State Building
comes to mind, but compared to NYC, São Paulo is much uglier,
more disorganized, less colorful (e.g. there are no yellow cabs,
the park (Ibirapuera) is not visible at all).</p>
</div>

<!-- Beer coolers -->

<div class="surprise">
<h3>132 GB memory stick</h3>
<p>People are selling large size memory sticks on the
street for very cheap (e.g. 50 BRL). Is this a scam?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="day">
<h2>2009-11-15</h2>
<div class="surprise">
<h3>Ibirapuera fish</h3>
<p>The ponds of Ibirapuera park are filled with swans, ducks and fish who all fight
with each other over the breadcrumbs that people feed them with.
I've never seen such concentration of fish before.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>São Paulo buses</h3>
<p>The buses are identified by a 6-digit number. Why so many?
In the bus
there is a ticket seller and a turnstile that both
allocate a considerable space and make entering the bus
a hassle, especially with bags.</p>
</div>

<h3>Long-distance buses</h3>
<p>The long-distance buses (e.g. from São Paulo to Rio)
are comfortable (AC, wide seats), reasonably fast (6h with a lunch stop)
and cheap (62.50 BRL).</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Aparecida Basilica</h3>
<p>On the way from São Paulo to Rio (6h bus journey) passed a massive
church. Later it turned out to be the Aparecida Basilica, one of the
largest catholic temples in the world. The whole setting
(the church, a footbridge leading to it, and a neighboring town) looked weird
and out of proportion.</p>

<p>Brazilian architecture is dominated by big and ugly skyscrapers.</p>

<h3>"Baboon"</h3>
<p>Some guy tried to grab and run away with our photo camera in down-town Rio
(reminding a bit a baboon who stole a pack of our biscuits in Livingstone, Zambia).
The camera was attached to the camera bag which Cs wore around her body.
So the "baboon" failed but created a nasty surprise nevertheless.</p>

<h3>The structure of Vila Canoas</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1130019.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>Vila Canoas (one of the smaller <em>favelas</em> of Rio) is a complex 3D construction
covering a hillside. All its narrow streets, little squares, staircases,
even rivers, are <b>inside</b> this construction.</p>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>"19A23"; "Rio de Janeiro x Belo Horizonte"</h3>
<p>Our bus from Rio to Belo Horizonte was going to leave from platform "19A23".
There were platforms numbered 1 to about 60, and grouped by letters (A, B, ...),
about 10 numbers for each group. Platform "19A23" didn't exist. We tried but couldn't
figure out on our own where we are supposed to wait for the bus. So we asked
the tourist information. Turned out that "A" stands for &ndash; (<em>ndash</em>)
in Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese?), i.e. 19&ndash;23, i.e. the bus will leave from either one of
platforms 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. These platforms are all next to each other
and are used by the same bus company.</p>

<p>In some cases an "x" is used to denote &ndash;,
e.g. in "Rio de Janeiro x Belo Horizonte".</p>

<h3>Glazed tiles (<em>azulejo</em>)</h3>
<p>In the Carmo district of the center of Salvador,
many houses are covered with tiles, making them look like
bathrooms turned inside out.</p>

<p>Later it turned out that
the tiles are even a bigger deal in São Luis, where
even the traffic lights are covered with tiles
(actually a tile-imitating wallpaper).</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Carybé 27 panels of cedar wood depicting candomblé orixas of Bahia</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1130305.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>Candomblé is a religion practiced mostly in Bahia. It
mixes Christianity with African religions.
Orixas are the candomblé deities. Carybé is a Brazilian
artist.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Candomblé</h3>
<p>I vaguely remember a description of a candomblé ceremony
in "Foucault's Pendulum" (or maybe it was <em>umbanda</em>, a related religion,
that was described there).
What we got to see in a small <em>terreiro</em> in Pelhourinho was a lot more
boring. A group of 5&ndash;7 people walking in circle in
a small room singing, led by a drum beat produced by about 4 teenage kids in
the corner of the room. After about 45 minutes, one of
the walkers fell into "trance" (i.e. had difficulties walking, but seemed very happy).
The ceremony then continued outside where everybody
just watched the gentleman-in-trance. He was walking up and down the street,
shouting and occasionally drinking from an half-empty bottle of whiskey.
(Was his trance mainly fueled by the first half?) After a while everybody
was asked to join in and circle around in front of the <em>terreiro</em> building.
This seemed to mark the end of the event, but as we left,
we don't know if it actually ended.</p>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Hammock deck</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1140013.JPG" title="Hammock deck on N/M Santarém"/>
</div>
<p>The larger river boats that go e.g. from Belem to Manaus
officially take about 500 passengers.
There are very few cabins/suites on the boat (about 10),
so most people travel on the hammock deck and sleep
in their hammocks (a trip like Belem&ndash;Manaus takes 5 nights).
The hammock decks can get very crowded as there doesn't seem
to be any enforced limit as to how many passengers the boat accepts.
I've tried to count a couple of times how many hammocks there actually are,
but always gotten confused. There are no designated hammock slots, just
a set of iron poles running from the front to the back of the deck
where people can sling their hammocks, often on top of each other, or
along the sides of the boat.
This makes counting very difficult. The people are remarkably friendly to
each other, I haven't noticed any form of aggression take place even though
people have to travel for several days in such a compact form.</p>

<h3>River people</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1130934.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>About 15h from Belem upstream (on a slow boat) the riversides
are covered by a jungle unlike seen elsewhere along the Rio Amazonas
(where it's often ranches and small villages). There are occasional long houses on
stilts and when their people see a boat approaching they hop into their canoes
and paddle onto the middle of the river. The people on the boat throw
clothes wrapped in plastic bags into the river which the canoe people then
collect. Some of the river people hook their canoes
to the boat (which continues moving without slowing down) and come on board to
ask for donations (in the form of clothes). It is usually children e.g. one
canoe contained three little girls who all successfully jumped on the boat
like little pirates. Grown-ups sometimes come to sell their food products
(palm heart, [BUG: what else]) on the boat. I guess their food is quite welcome as it
provides some alternative to the daily rice+beans+spaghetti+chicken+farinha terror.</p>

<h3>Henry Ford and Prince Charles</h3>
<p>To ensure stable rubber supply Henry Ford established
two rubber-producing towns close to Santarém &mdash; Belterra and Fordlândia. By now
Fordlândia doesn't operate anymore but Belterra is still active.
Both look like typical little American towns. Henry Ford never visited the
Amazonas being afraid of malaria. (We did not visit these towns as both
were hard to reach, especially Fordlândia. This info here is based on
the "Rough Guide to Brazil" and our local guide.)</p>

<h3>Sounds of nature at Pousada Uacari</h3>
<p>An invisible source is roaring in the jungle. It sounds

<p>The channel/river that the lodge is floating on is filled
with pirarucu (<em>pirakas kala</em>). It's a 2m long fish
that likes to jump partly out of the water creating a loud
splash sound. This happens about once every minute.</p>

<h3>Egrets preparing to sleep</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1140679.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>Leaving the Mamiraua lake at sundown we passed by
a couple of trees where egrets (huge white birds)
were preparing to spend the night. The green trees were now
rendered half white. The egrets stick together on the same tree
for the night for security reasons. Other birds, e.g.
the smaller snowy egrets and even cormorants are allowed
to stay on the same trees as well.</p>

<p>UPDATE (2010-05-17): Such egret-trees are by no means specific to the Amazonas,
e.g. passed by a similar tree on the Esplanade in Cairns, Australia,
every evening when we walked to the Woolshed pub for the free pasta dish.</p>

<h3>Arrival to Iquitos</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1150021.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>Arriving to Iquitos from Tabatinga on a fast boat I expected
another Amazonian town, something like Tefé but bigger.
However, the contrast to Brazil was huge. The public transport
is largely based on <em>motocarro</em>s (3-wheeled modified motor bikes)
giving the town an Asian feel; people are more aggressively selling
their stuff (taxi service, jungle trips, T-shirts), reminding East-Africa
a bit; the down-town area (around Plaza de Armas) has several establishments
(hostels, restaurants, tour operators) owned by an American expat community.</p>
<p>Right after
arriving in Iquitos we decided to take the moto-taxi to the main port
to check for departures to Pantoja (border town to Ecuador).
At the port we immediately attracted everybody's attention (children,
beggars, drunks). The boat (Jeisawel) looked like a cargo boat,
was small and run-down and was going to leave on "Saturday or Monday".</p>

<h3>Market and the water city of Belén</h3>
<p>Just a 10-minute walk away from Plaza de Armas
is the extremely busy and crowded market of Belén where one can buy everything from radios
and firecrackers to worms (which locals eat for snacks) and armadillo meat. One side street
is dedicated entirely to medicinal plants (e.g. natural VIAGRA).</p>

<div class="image">

</div>

<p>Walking down the staircase to the river one reaches the part of town
that gets flooded during the wet season. The houses are thus built on stilts
(there are schools, churches, hospitals), and even further on the river
the houses are floating (there is an Amazonian tree [BUG: name?]
with excellent floating properties, this is used as the foundation of
the buildings). For 7 Soles a canoe man will take you for a tour around
the floating city, including a trip to <em>Victoria regia</em>, the huge
lily plant, that is growing in somebody's "back yard". The beginning of
the trip, i.e. around the area where water meets dry land,
is a disgusting ride among floating garbage and waste, Belém is very dirty.</p>
<p>Belén has 60,000 inhabitants
(the total number of people living in Iquitos is 400,000).</p>

<h3>Feeding the Amazonian manatees</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/P1150175.JPG" title=""/>
</div>
<p>About 8km from down-town Iquitos there is a manatee orphanage (free entry, donation
expected).
The project has saved 8 manatees from the local communities, GPS-tagged them,
and plans to reintroduce them into the wild at some point. The manatees are
kept in two pools &mdash; 4 older ones in a bigger pool (we didn't see them
surface) and 4 smaller ones in a smaller pool. The smaller ones are curious
and frequently stick their heads out of the water. They like to eat all the time
but strongly prefer milk to the water lettuce that abundantly covers the pool.
The guests are allowed to feed the manatees with milk from baby bottles.
This is the highlight of the whole experience. The concentrated way (the little eyes
closed) how the manatee sucked the milk was surprising.</p>
<p>This project is coordinated
by the Dallas World Aquarium and is quite new (2 years) so that our guide books
do not mention it. We have have added a section to
the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Iquitos">Wikitravel's article on Iquitos</a>
now.</p>

<p>A little known fact: the manatee is the closest living relative to
the elephant and to the rock hyrax, see also
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paenungulata">Wikipedia: Paenungulata</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="surprise">
<h3>Weird animals in the Quistococha zoo</h3>
<p>10km from down-town Iquitos by lake Quistococha is a zoo
that displays the South American animals (puma, peccary, tapir, capybara,
various monkeys (squirrel, spider, red uakari, capuchin),
otter, cayman, river turtle, pink dolphin, coati,
<em>pirarucu</em> [BUG: what's the Spanish name?],
macaw and other birds). Most animals are kept in poor conditions
in small and smelly cages. Surprising was a parrot that whistled and said "Hola!"
(I haven't heard a parrot talk before) and an ant-eater who was roaming
freely about the zoo. Also, got a better view to the pink dolphin. In Mamiraua,
they only briefly showed their back. Here the dolphin stuck out his long rostrum
for a longer period of time, expecting to be fed and also turned in the water, almost
touching its tail with the rostrum. (Unlike other dolphins, the pink river dolphins have
extremely flexible bodies, allowing them to effectively fish in the flooded forest.)</p>

in the water they were just jumping in the waves. Many people

<p>The next day when we visited Huanchaco as part of the Chan Chan tour
the waves were even bigger. There was a Canadian guy on our tour who had
been surfing at home, in the cold Canadian waters.
He said that these waves here are small,

<h3>Moche (Mochica) culture and a Soviet cartoon</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="../images/moche_sacrifice.jpg"/>
</div>

<p>Before the organized tour to Huaca de la Luna, we visited
the small Museo Arquelógico de la Universidad de Trujillo,
a few blocks from Plaza de Armas. The museum focuses on the
pre-Inca cultures found in this region of Peru,
mainly Moche (approx. 100BC&ndash;700AD)
and Chimú (approx. 900AD&ndash;1400AD).
The Moche people had created a lot of pottery with painted
figures on them. It was surprising to realize that I had
seen these figures before, in a Soviet cartoon that
scared/impressed me when I was a child.</p>

<p>I didn't remember much of the cartoon. I think it started with
explaining the setup of the society of the characters. There were three levels:
gods, people, the under water world. It was possible to move between
these worlds, e.g. the gods descended to the level of people once,
fisherman pulled out fish (or the other way around), etc. The cartoon
then told a story, don't remember anything of it, but a central
figure there was a snake-like animal (a negative character in the story)
who at the end of the story was forced to live forever on the Moon.
(That's why the Moon has the black spots, it is this animal.)</p>

<p>Huaca de la Luna is a temple/pyramid built on a hillside.
Whenever a king died, he was buried in the pyramid, all the
rooms filled with bricks, and a new layer built on top of the
previous layer (now a tomb). This arrangement has made sure
that all the rooms and their wall decorations are very well preserved,
although there are marks of abuse by the <em>conquistadores</em> and the <em>El Niño</em>.
(The nearby Huaca del Sol has suffered much more through <em>conquistadores</em>
who diverted the Moche river to go through the building in an effort to
destroy it.)
So the visitor can see the real thing, the archaeologists have only removed a
few original bricks to display the rooms of the lower levels of the pyramid and
cleaned up the wall decorations. (In the historical Chimú site of Chan Chan
it's different, there the old city is recreated from scratch, on
top of the original foundation.)</p>

<p>The wall decorations showed only a very few characters (monster face,
spider or crab, a snake-like figure, a warrior). The same figure was repeated
multiple times. In the snake-like figure (that was described on an information stand
as "lunar being") I recognized the cartoon character that was forced to live on the Moon.
I had many questions to the guide
&mdash;
Has there any pottery been found at the <em>huacas</em>?
Is this the main archaeological site of Moche culture in Peru?
Did the characters have names? (I was sure that in the cartoon the "lunar being" was called something else.)
Are the Moche legends known?
&mdash;
but he didn't really know or wasn't that willing to answer.
Next to the temple a museum is being built, it will probably tell a more detailed
story of the Moche culture along with displaying the pottery. When we where there it was
still closed.
So my efforts to find out more about the background and sources of the Soviet
cartoon failed.</p>

<div class="right">
<img src="../images/rekuai.jpg"/>
</div>

<p>Finding more information about the cartoon on the internet was not straight-forward.
It went something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>made an assumption that the cartoon was produced by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuzmultfilm">Soyuzmultfilm</a>,
the main Soviet animation studio;</li>
<li>made an assumption that most information about this cartoon is
found in the Russian-speaking web;</li>

<p>This article gives a full description of the cartoon
along with pictures. I read it using Google Translate. The translation is
linguistically poor but otherwise correct, or at least compatible with my memories
of the cartoon that now come back to me. The main characters in the story
are two brothers (some sort of semi-gods) who come to people to
give them food, educate them and fight with their monsters. One of the monsters
is the snake-like being Rekuay. Rekuay is difficult to fight but loses in the
end and escapes to the Moon.</p>

<p>Later also tried to search for "Soyuzmultfilm Moche" and on the first
results' page found a link to
<a href="http://fer-textos.blogspot.com/2008/08/video-mochica.html">a blog entry "Video Mochicas"</a>
that embeds

<h3>Pululawa crater and fog</h3>

<p>I naively hoped to see some bubbling lava in the Pululawa crater (depth: 200m?, area: ?),
but instead it offered a view to a small village, as if on the palm of your hand,
which was also surprising.
The fog was pulling in, completely blocking the view, and then again
revealing the village.</p>

<p>We were told that local children walk up and down
along a steep path to go to school every day.
There seems to be a bigger road as well at the other end of the crater
to allow cars to enter the crater.</p>

<p>One can easily arrange a 2h trip to the Pululawa crater
from the Cuidad de Mitad del Mundo. Most of the time on this
trip is unfortunately spent in a weird Temple of the Sun, which
seems to be nothing more than a personal project of some artist
(Cristobal Ortega?).</p>

the event was not that surprising anymore, but still interesting. In our case the losing cocks did not
die, although there was blood and lots of feathers on the arena after the fight.</p>

<p>The Otavalo tourist information claimed that cock fights in Otavalo have stopped (didn't understand
the reason), but still pointed out the location where the fights used to take place
(Lonely Planet mentions this location as well).
When we were on our way there, a local policeman
approached us in good English to find out if we are lost. We said that we are interested in cock fights.
The policeman pointed out the location and highly recommended the event. Asking some locals, everybody
confirmed that cock fights take place, but everybody was unclear when does it exactly start (6-8 pm).
It eventually started around 10pm, we stayed there till midnight.</p>

<h3>Volcanic eruptions</h3>

<p>The Tungurahua volcano above the town of Baños has been more active since 1999,
with a couple of major eruptions that have caused the whole town to be evacuated.
Smaller eruptions seem to occur daily.
A company takes people every night at 9pm to a viewing platform
400m higher than the town to observe the eruptions.</p>

<p>It was quite cloudy and I didn't think volcanoes erupt very frequently,
so what we actually saw during approx. 1 hour on the viewing platform
was surprising. There were about 10 eruptions &mdash; first a thundering sound then
some red glow with some red dots. A couple of times the activity was bigger &mdash; the mountain
(which wasn't otherwise visible because of clouds and darkness) was painted
red, the red lava  was flowing while more pieces of lava were thrown out of the mountain.
Each sighting lasted for about 20 seconds before the lava cooled down and became invisible.</p>

<p>Now observed during daytime (15&ndash;16 o'clock) from the
hillside across the river from Baños. Every couple of minutes
a tower of thick smoke burst out of the volcano. With the binoculars
one could also observe little stones (?) emerging from the smoke
(i.e. they were little relative to the surroundings).</p>

<p>According to the advisory
<a href="http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/VAAC/ARCH10/TUNG/2010A122318.html">12 Jan 2010 - 2318 UTC -- TUNGURAHUA 1502-08 ECUADOR</a>

<p>We had seen already several animals at the Puerto Ayora port (marine iguanas,
sea lions, pelicans, etc.), but didn't expect to see a marine iguana swimming.
The swimming resembled floating, as its legs did not move.
Nevertheless the change of position was very rapid and directed.
Darwin described it like this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When in the water this lizard swims with perfect ease and quickness,
by a serpentine movement of its body and flattened tail &mdash; the legs
being motionless and closely collapsed on its sides.</p>

</div>
<p>The flight over the Nazca lines with <a href="http://aerocondor.com.pe">Aero Condor</a>
lasted 35 minutes and visited some 15 figures
and huge number of lines and trapezoids. You can repeat this flight in Google Maps/Earth

<p>I had never flown in such a tiny airplane (Cessna C172, 3 passengers and the pilot), so already
this was surprising. The lines were less surprising than expected, there were many dry river beds,
dirt roads, some graffiti etc. which made the lines less stand out. Also, as there is nothing else on the
pampa, it is difficult to estimate/appreciate the size of the figures and lines. The Panamericana that crosses
the pampa (and a few figures) helps a bit in putting things into perspective.</p>

<h3>Cactus/worm/paint farm</h3>
<p>The Cantalloc aqueducts were surprising but what surprised me even

have simply failed to fight this infection but the guide then told
that the focus of this farm is not the cactus but a white worm
called <em>cochinilla</em>, the cactuses are just its food.</p>

<div class="image">

<p>The <em>cochinilla</em> worm, when crushed, reveals a surprisingly

this natural paint to color their textiles &mdash; the color is said
to be long-lasting and bright.</p>

<p>South America has not seemed like the best place for buying books.
